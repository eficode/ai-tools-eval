[AI-INSTRUCTION] Robot Framework Testing Standards

[1. CORE COMPLIANCE]
    MANDATORY SOURCE AUTHORITY: Use ONLY library keywords found via rf-docs-mcp tools and local JSON documentation in robotframework-mcp:/app/docs/. Any keyword not found in these specific locations is INVALID.
    SYNTAX STANDARD: Adhere strictly to Robot Framework 7.4.1 syntax and modern best practices.
    VALIDATED VERSIONS: Validate code against robotframework==7.4.1, robotframework-browser==19.12.3, and robotframework-requests==0.9.7.

[2. ARCHITECTURAL PATTERNS]
    PAGE OBJECT MODEL: Implement the Page Object pattern for all UI tests to ensure long-term maintainability.
    RESOURCE ABSTRACTION: Place all reusable keywords in dedicated Resource Files; do not define global logic within test suites.
    SEPARATION OF CONCERNS: Maintain a strict separation of logic within keywords to prevent monolithic code blocks.
    TEST TEMPLATES: Utilize Test Templates for data-driven scenarios to minimize code duplication.

[3. TEST LOGIC & STABILITY]
    WAIT STRATEGY: Use Explicit Wait conditions (e.g., Wait Until...). STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Fixed Sleep commands.
    INDEPENDENCE: Ensure every test is order-agnostic and fully independent.
    ERROR RESILIENCE: Implement structured error handling and recovery within test cases.
    FLAKINESS PREVENTION: Design all interactions to be stable and predictable.

[4. METADATA & DATA MANAGEMENT]
    BEHAVIORAL NAMING: Use Behavior-Focused names describing user actions (e.g., User Should Be Able To...).
    DOCUMENTATION: Every keyword MUST have a clear [Documentation] block.
    VARIABLE SCOPE: Use variables for all dynamic values; NO HARDCODED STRINGS.
    DATA ISOLATION: Ensure test data is uniquely generated and isolated for each execution.
    LIFECYCLE HOOKS: Implement robust Setup and Teardown procedures for every suite and test.
    ORGANIZATION: Logically group tests into suites using effective Tagging for categorization and filtering.
