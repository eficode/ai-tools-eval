<doc>Browser library is a browser automation library for Robot Framework.

This is the keyword documentation for Browser library. For information
about installation, support, and more please visit the
[https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-playwright|project pages].
For more information about Robot Framework itself, see [https://robotframework.org|robotframework.org].

Browser library uses
[https://github.com/microsoft/playwright|Playwright Node module]
to automate [https://www.chromium.org/Home|Chromium],
[https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/|Firefox]
and [https://webkit.org/|WebKit] with a single library.

= Browser, Context and Page =

Browser library works with three different layers that build on each other:
*Browser*, *Context* and *Page*.


== Browsers ==

A *browser* can be started with one of the three
different engines Chromium, Firefox or Webkit.

=== Supported Browsers ===

|   Browser     | Browser with this engine                          |
| ``chromium``  | Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge (since 2020), Opera |
| ``firefox``   | Mozilla Firefox                                   |
| ``webkit``    | Apple Safari, Mail, AppStore on MacOS and iOS     |

Since [https://github.com/microsoft/playwright|Playwright] comes with a pack of builtin
binaries for all browsers, no additional drivers e.g. geckodriver are needed.

All these browsers that cover more than 85% of the world wide used browsers,
can be tested on Windows, Linux and MacOS.
There is no need for dedicated machines anymore.

A browser process is started ``headless`` (without a GUI) by default.
Run `New Browser` with specified arguments if a browser with a GUI is requested
or if a proxy has to be configured.
A browser process can contain several contexts.


== Contexts ==

A *context* corresponds to a set of independent incognito pages in a browser
that share cookies, sessions or profile settings. Pages in two separate
contexts do not share cookies, sessions or profile settings.
Compared to Selenium, these do *not* require their own browser process.
To get a clean environment a test can just open a new context.
Due to this new independent browser sessions can be opened with
Robot Framework Browser about 10 times faster than with Selenium by
just opening a `New Context` within the opened browser.

To make pages in the same suite share state, use the same context by opening the
context with `New Context` on suite setup.

The context layer is useful e.g. for testing different user sessions on the
same webpage without opening a whole new browser context.
Contexts can also have detailed configurations, such as geo-location, language settings,
the viewport size or color scheme.
Contexts do also support http credentials to be set, so that basic authentication
can also be tested. To be able to download files within the test,
the ``acceptDownloads`` argument must be set to ``True`` in `New Context` keyword.
A context can contain different pages.


== Pages ==

A *page* does contain the content of the loaded web site and has a browsing history.
Pages and browser tabs are the same.

Typical usage could be:
| *** Test Cases ***
| Starting a browser with a page
|     New Browser    chromium    headless=false
|     New Context    viewport={'width': 1920, 'height': 1080}
|     New Page       https://marketsquare.github.io/robotframework-browser/Browser.html
|     Get Title      ==    Browser

The `Open Browser` keyword opens a new browser, a new context and a new page.
This keyword is useful for quick experiments or debugging sessions.

When a `New Page` is called without an open browser, `New Browser`
and `New Context` are executed with default values first.

Each Browser, Context and Page has a unique ID with which they can be addressed.
A full catalog of what is open can be received by `Get Browser Catalog` as a dictionary.

= Automatic page and context closing =

Controls when contexts and pages are closed during the test execution.

    If automatic closing level is `TEST`, contexts and pages that are created during a single test are
    automatically closed when the test ends. Contexts and pages that are created during suite setup are
    closed when the suite teardown ends.

    If automatic closing level is `SUITE`, all contexts and pages that are created during the test suite
    are closed when the suite teardown ends.

    If automatic closing level is `MANUAL`, nothing is closed automatically while the test execution
    is ongoing. All browsers, context and pages are automatically closed when test execution ends.

    If automatic closing level is `KEEP`, nothing is closed automatically while the test execution
    is ongoing. Also, nothing is closed when test execution ends, including the node process. Therefore,
    it is users responsibility to close all browsers, context and pages and ensure that all process
    that are left running after the test execution end are closed. This level is only intended for
    test case development and must not be used when running tests in CI or similar environments.

    Automatic closing can be configured or switched off with the auto_closing_level library import
    parameter.

    See: `Importing`

= Finding elements =

All keywords in the library that need to interact with an element
on a web page take an argument typically named ``selector`` that specifies
how to find the element. Keywords can find elements with strict mode. If
strict mode is true and locator finds multiple elements from the page, keyword
will fail. If keyword finds one element, keyword does not fail because of
strict mode. If strict mode is false, keyword does not fail if selector points
many elements. Strict mode is enabled by default, but can be changed in library
`importing` or `Set Strict Mode` keyword. Keyword documentation states if keyword
uses strict mode. If keyword does not state that strict mode is used, then strict
mode is not applied for the keyword. For more details, see Playwright
[https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-query-selector|strict documentation].

Selector strategies that are supported by default are listed in the table
below.

| = Strategy = |     = Match based on =     |         = Example =                |
| ``css``      | CSS selector.              | ``css=.class &gt; \#login_btn``      |
| ``xpath``    | XPath expression.          | ``xpath=//input[@id="login_btn"]`` |
| ``text``     | Browser text engine.       | ``text=Login``                     |
| ``id``       | Element ID Attribute.      | ``id=login_btn``                   |

CSS Selectors can also be recorded with `Record selector` keyword.

== Explicit Selector Strategy ==

The explicit selector strategy is specified with a prefix using syntax
``strategy=value``. Spaces around the separator are ignored, so
``css=foo``, ``css= foo`` and ``css = foo`` are all equivalent.


== Implicit Selector Strategy ==

*The default selector strategy is `css`.*

If selector does not contain one of the know explicit selector strategies, it is
assumed to contain css selector.

Selectors that are starting with ``//`` or ``..`` are considered as xpath selectors.

Selectors that are in quotes are considered as text selectors.

Examples:

| # CSS selectors are default.
| `Click`  span &gt; button.some_class         # This is equivalent
| `Click`  css=span &gt; button.some_class     # to this.
|
| # // or .. leads to xpath selector strategy
| `Click`  //span/button[@class="some_class"]
| `Click`  xpath=//span/button[@class="some_class"]
|
| # "text" in quotes leads to exact text selector strategy
| `Click`  "Login"
| `Click`  text="Login"


== CSS ==

As written before, the default selector strategy is `css`. See
[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors | css selector]
for more information.

Any malformed selector not starting with ``//`` or ``..`` nor starting and ending
with a quote is assumed to be a css selector.

Note that ``#`` is a comment character in [https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#ignored-data | Robot Framework syntax] and needs to be
escaped like ``\#`` to work as a [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/ID_selectors | css ID selector].

Examples:
| `Click`  span &gt; button.some_class
| `Get Text`  \#username_field  ==  George


== XPath ==

XPath engine is equivalent to [https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Document/evaluate|Document.evaluate].
Example: ``xpath=//html/body//span[text()="Hello World"]``.

Malformed selector starting with ``//`` or ``..`` is assumed to be an xpath selector.
For example, ``//html/body`` is converted to ``xpath=//html/body``. More
examples are displayed in `Examples`.

Note that xpath does not pierce [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM|shadow_roots].


== Text ==

Text engine finds an element that contains a text node with the passed text.
For example, ``Click    text=Login`` clicks on a login button, and
``Wait For Elements State   text="lazy loaded text"`` waits for the "lazy loaded text"
to appear in the page.

Text engine finds fields based on their labels in text inserting keywords.

Malformed selector starting and ending with a quote (either ``"`` or ``'``) is assumed
to be a text selector. For example, ``Click    "Login"`` is converted to ``Click    text="Login"``.
Be aware that these leads to exact matches only!
More examples are displayed in `Examples`.


=== Insensitive match ===

By default, the match is case-insensitive, ignores leading/trailing whitespace and
searches for a substring. This means ``text= Login`` matches
``&lt;button&gt;Button loGIN (click me)&lt;/button&gt;``.

=== Exact match ===

Text body can be escaped with single or double quotes for precise matching,
insisting on exact match, including specified whitespace and case.
This means ``text="Login "`` will only match ``&lt;button&gt;Login &lt;/button&gt;`` with exactly
one space after "Login". Quoted text follows the usual escaping rules, e.g.
use ``\"`` to escape double quote in a double-quoted string: ``text="foo\"bar"``.

=== RegEx ===

Text body can also be a JavaScript-like regex wrapped in / symbols.
This means ``text=/^hello .*!$/i`` or ``text=/^Hello .*!$/`` will match ``&lt;span&gt;Hello Peter Parker!&lt;/span&gt;``
with any name after ``Hello``, ending with ``!``.
The first one flagged with ``i`` for case-insensitive.
See [https://regex101.com/|https://regex101.com] for more information about RegEx.

=== Button and Submit Values ===

Input elements of the type button and submit are rendered with their value as text,
and text engine finds them. For example, ``text=Login`` matches
``&lt;input type=button value="Login"&gt;``.

== Cascaded selector syntax ==

Browser library supports the same selector strategies as the underlying
Playwright node module: xpath, css, id and text. The strategy can either
be explicitly specified with a prefix or the strategy can be implicit.

A major advantage of Browser is that multiple selector engines can be used
within one selector. It is possible to mix XPath, CSS and Text selectors while
selecting a single element.

Selectors are strings that consists of one or more clauses separated by
``&gt;&gt;`` token, e.g. ``clause1 &gt;&gt; clause2 &gt;&gt; clause3``. When multiple clauses
are present, next one is queried relative to the previous one's result.
Browser library supports concatenation of different selectors separated by ``&gt;&gt;``.

For example:
| `Highlight Elements`    "Hello" &gt;&gt; ../.. &gt;&gt; .select_button
| `Highlight Elements`    text=Hello &gt;&gt; xpath=../.. &gt;&gt; css=.select_button

Each clause contains a selector engine name and selector body, e.g.
``engine=body``. Here ``engine`` is one of the supported engines (e.g. css or
a custom one). Selector ``body`` follows the format of the particular engine,
e.g. for css engine it should be a [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors | css selector].
Body format is assumed to ignore leading and trailing white spaces,
so that extra whitespace can be added for readability. If the selector
engine needs to include ``&gt;&gt;`` in the body, it should be escaped
inside a string to not be confused with clause separator,
e.g. ``text="some &gt;&gt; text"``.

Selector engine name can be prefixed with ``*`` to capture an element that
matches the particular clause instead of the last one. For example,
``css=article &gt;&gt; text=Hello`` captures the element with the text ``Hello``,
and ``*css=article &gt;&gt; text=Hello`` (note the *) captures the article element
that contains some element with the text Hello.

For convenience, selectors in the wrong format are heuristically converted
to the right format. See `Implicit Selector Strategy`

== Examples ==
| # queries 'div' css selector
| Get Element    css=div
|
| # queries '//html/body/div' xpath selector
| Get Element    //html/body/div
|
| # queries '"foo"' text selector
| Get Element    text=foo
|
| # queries 'span' css selector inside the result of '//html/body/div' xpath selector
| Get Element    xpath=//html/body/div &gt;&gt; css=span
|
| # converted to 'css=div'
| Get Element    div
|
| # converted to 'xpath=//html/body/div'
| Get Element    //html/body/div
|
| # converted to 'text="foo"'
| Get Element    "foo"
|
| # queries the div element of every 2nd span element inside an element with the id foo
| Get Element    \#foo &gt;&gt; css=span:nth-child(2n+1) &gt;&gt; div
| Get Element    id=foo &gt;&gt; css=span:nth-child(2n+1) &gt;&gt; div

Be aware that using ``#`` as a starting character in Robot Framework would be interpreted as comment.
Due to that fact a ``#id`` must be escaped as ``\#id``.

== iFrames ==

By default, selector chains do not cross frame boundaries. It means that a
simple CSS selector is not able to select an element located inside an iframe
or a frameset. For this use case, there is a special selector ``&gt;&gt;&gt;`` which can
be used to combine a selector for the frame and a selector for an element
inside a frame.

Given this simple pseudo html snippet:
| &lt;iframe id="iframe" src="src.html"&gt;
|   #document
|     &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
|     &lt;html&gt;
|       &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
|       &lt;body&gt;
|         &lt;button id="btn"&gt;Click Me&lt;/button&gt;
|       &lt;/body&gt;
|     &lt;/html&gt;
| &lt;/iframe&gt;

Here's a keyword call that clicks the button inside the frame.

| Click   id=iframe &gt;&gt;&gt; id=btn

The selectors on the left and right side of ``&gt;&gt;&gt;`` can be any valid selectors.
The selector clause directly before the frame opener ``&gt;&gt;&gt;`` must select the frame element itself.
Frame selection is the only place where Browser Library modifies the selector, as explained in above.
In all cases, the library does not alter the selector in any way, instead it is passed as is to the
Playwright side.

If multiple keyword shall be performed inside a frame,
it is possible to define a selector prefix with `Set Selector Prefix`.
If this prefix is set to a frame/iframe it has similar behavior as SeleniumLibrary keyword `Select Frame`.

== WebComponents and Shadow DOM ==

Playwright and so also Browser are able to do automatic piercing of Shadow DOMs
and therefore are the best automation technology when working with WebComponents.

Also other technologies claim that they can handle
[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM|Shadow DOM and Web Components].
However, none of them do pierce shadow roots automatically,
which may be inconvenient when working with Shadow DOM and Web Components.

For that reason, the css engine pierces shadow roots. More specifically, every
[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Descendant_combinator|Descendant combinator]
pierces an arbitrary number of open shadow roots, including the implicit descendant combinator
at the start of the selector.

That means, it is not necessary to select each shadow host, open its shadow root and
select the next shadow host until you reach the element that should be controlled.

=== CSS:light ===

``css:light`` engine is equivalent to [https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector | Document.querySelector]
and behaves according to the CSS spec.
However, it does not pierce shadow roots.

``css`` engine first searches for elements in the light dom in the iteration order,
and then recursively inside open shadow roots in the iteration order. It does not
search inside closed shadow roots or iframes.

Examples:

| &lt;article&gt;
|   &lt;div&gt;In the light dom&lt;/div&gt;
|   &lt;div slot='myslot'&gt;In the light dom, but goes into the shadow slot&lt;/div&gt;
|   &lt;open mode shadow root&gt;
|       &lt;div class='in-the-shadow'&gt;
|           &lt;span class='content'&gt;
|               In the shadow dom
|               &lt;open mode shadow root&gt;
|                   &lt;li id='target'&gt;Deep in the shadow&lt;/li&gt;
|               &lt;/open mode shadow root&gt;
|           &lt;/span&gt;
|       &lt;/div&gt;
|       &lt;slot name='myslot'&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;
|   &lt;/open mode shadow root&gt;
| &lt;/article&gt;

Note that ``&lt;open mode shadow root&gt;`` is not an html element, but rather a shadow root
created with ``element.attachShadow({mode: 'open'})``.

- Both ``"css=article div"`` and ``"css:light=article div"`` match the first ``&lt;div&gt;In the light dom&lt;/div&gt;``.
- Both ``"css=article &gt; div"`` and ``"css:light=article &gt; div"`` match two ``div`` elements that are direct children of the ``article``.
- ``"css=article .in-the-shadow"`` matches the ``&lt;div class='in-the-shadow'&gt;``, piercing the shadow root, while ``"css:light=article .in-the-shadow"`` does not match anything.
- ``"css:light=article div &gt; span"`` does not match anything, because both light-dom ``div`` elements do not contain a ``span``.
- ``"css=article div &gt; span"`` matches the ``&lt;span class='content'&gt;``, piercing the shadow root.
- ``"css=article &gt; .in-the-shadow"`` does not match anything, because ``&lt;div class='in-the-shadow'&gt;`` is not a direct child of ``article``
- ``"css:light=article &gt; .in-the-shadow"`` does not match anything.
- ``"css=article li#target"`` matches the ``&lt;li id='target'&gt;Deep in the shadow&lt;/li&gt;``, piercing two shadow roots.

=== text:light ===

``text`` engine open pierces shadow roots similarly to ``css``, while ``text:light`` does not.
Text engine first searches for elements in the light dom in the iteration order, and then
recursively inside open shadow roots in the iteration order. It does not search inside
closed shadow roots or iframes.

=== id, data-testid, data-test-id, data-test and their :light counterparts ===

Attribute engines are selecting based on the corresponding attribute value.
For example: ``data-test-id=foo`` is equivalent to ``css=[data-test-id="foo"]``,
and ``id:light=foo`` is equivalent to ``css:light=[id="foo"]``.

== Element reference syntax ==

It is possible to get a reference to a Locator by using `Get Element` and `Get Elements` keywords.
Keywords do not save reference to an element in the HTML document, instead it saves reference to a Playwright
[https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator|Locator]. In nutshell Locator captures the logic of how to
retrieve that element from the page. Each time an action is performed, the locator re-searches the elements
in the page. This reference can be used as a *first* part of a selector by using a special selector
syntax `element=`. like this:

| ${ref}=    Get Element    .some_class
|            Click          ${ref} &gt;&gt; .some_child     # Locator searches an element from the page.
|            Click          ${ref} &gt;&gt; .other_child    # Locator searches again an element from the page.

The `.some_child` and `.other_child` selectors in the example are relative to the element referenced
by ${ref}. Please note that frame piercing is not possible with element reference.

= Assertions =

Keywords that accept arguments ``assertion_operator`` &lt;`AssertionOperator`&gt; and ``assertion_expected``
can optionally assert that a specified condition holds. Keywords will return the value even when the
assertion is performed by the keyword.

Assert will retry and fail only after a specified timeout.
See `Importing` and ``retry_assertions_for`` (default is 1 second) for configuring this timeout.



    Currently supported assertion operators are:

    |      = Operator =   |   = Alternative Operators =          |              = Description =                                                       | = Validate Equivalent =              |
    | ``==``              | ``equal``, ``equals``, ``should be`` | Checks if returned value is equal to expected value.                               | ``value == expected``                |
    | ``!=``              | ``inequal``, ``should not be``       | Checks if returned value is not equal to expected value.                           | ``value != expected``                |
    | ``&gt;``               | ``greater than``                     | Checks if returned value is greater than expected value.                           | ``value &gt; expected``                 |
    | ``&gt;=``              |                                      | Checks if returned value is greater than or equal to expected value.               | ``value &gt;= expected``                |
    | ``&lt;``               | ``less than``                        | Checks if returned value is less than expected value.                              | ``value &lt; expected``                 |
    | ``&lt;=``              |                                      | Checks if returned value is less than or equal to expected value.                  | ``value &lt;= expected``                |
    | ``*=``              | ``contains``                         | Checks if returned value contains expected value as substring.                     | ``expected in value``                |
    |                     | ``not contains``                     | Checks if returned value does not contain expected value as substring.             | ``expected in value``                |
    | ``^=``              | ``should start with``, ``starts``    | Checks if returned value starts with expected value.                               | ``re.search(f"^{expected}", value)`` |
    | ``$=``              | ``should end with``, ``ends``        | Checks if returned value ends with expected value.                                 | ``re.search(f"{expected}$", value)`` |
    | ``matches``         |                                      | Checks if given RegEx matches minimum once in returned value.                      | ``re.search(expected, value)``       |
    | ``validate``        |                                      | Checks if given Python expression evaluates to ``True``.                           |                                      |
    | ``evaluate``        |  ``then``                            | When using this operator, the keyword does return the evaluated Python expression. |                                      |

    Currently supported formatters for assertions are:
    |     = Formatter =     |                      = Description =                       |
    |  ``normalize spaces`` | Substitutes multiple spaces to single space from the value |
    |       ``strip``       | Removes spaces from the beginning and end of the value     |
    | ``case insensitive``  | Converts value to lower case before comparing              |
    | ``apply to expected`` | Applies rules also for the expected value                  |

    Formatters are applied to the value before assertion is performed and keywords returns a value where rule is
    applied. Formatter is only applied to the value which keyword returns and not all rules are valid for all assertion
    operators. If ``apply to expected`` formatter is defined, then formatters are then formatter are also applied to
    expected value.
    

By default, keywords will provide an error message if an assertion fails.
Default error messages can be overwritten with a ``message`` argument.
The ``message`` argument accepts `{value}`, `{value_type}`, `{expected}` and
`{expected_type}` [https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format|format]
options.
The `{value}` is the value returned by the keyword and the `{expected}`
is the expected value defined by the user, usually the value in the
``assertion_expected`` argument. The `{value_type}` and
`{expected_type}` are the type definitions from `{value}` and `{expected}`
arguments. In similar fashion as Python
[https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#type|type] returns type definition.
Assertions will retry until ``timeout`` has expired if they do not pass.

The assertion ``assertion_expected`` value is not converted by the library and
is used as is. Therefore when assertion is made, the ``assertion_expected``
argument value and value returned the keyword must have the same type. If types
are not the same, assertion will fail. Example `Get Text` always returns a string
and has to be compared with a string, even the returned value might look like
a number.

Other Keywords have other specific types they return.
`Get Element Count` always returns an integer.
`Get Bounding Box` and `Get Viewport Size` can be filtered.
They return a dictionary without a filter and a number when filtered.
These Keywords do automatic conversion for the expected value if a number is returned.

* &lt; less or greater &gt; With Strings*
Comparisons of strings with ``greater than`` or ``less than`` compares each character,
starting from 0 regarding where it stands in the code page.
Example: ``A &lt; Z``, ``Z &lt; a``, ``ac &lt; dc`
It does never compare the length of elements. Neither lists nor strings.
The comparison stops at the first character that is different.
Examples: ``'abcde' &lt; 'abd'``, ``'100.000' &lt; '2'``
In Python 3 and therefore also in Browser it is not possible to compare numbers
with strings with a greater or less operator.
On keywords that return numbers, the given expected value is automatically
converted to a number before comparison.


The getters `Get Page State` and `Get Browser Catalog` return a dictionary. Values of the dictionary can directly asserted.
Pay attention of possible types because they are evaluated in Python. For example:

| Get Page State    validate    2020 &gt;= value['year']                     # Comparison of numbers
| Get Page State    validate    "IMPORTANT MESSAGE!" == value['message']  # Comparison of strings

== The 'then' or 'evaluate' closure ==

Keywords that accept arguments ``assertion_operator`` and ``assertion_expected``
can optionally also use ``then`` or ``evaluate`` closure to modify the returned value with
BuiltIn Evaluate. Actual value can be accessed with ``value``.

For example ``Get Title  then  'TITLE: '+value``.
See
[https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/libraries/BuiltIn.html#Evaluating%20expressions|
Builtin Evaluating expressions]
for more info on the syntax.

== Examples ==

| # *Keyword*    *Selector*                    *Key*        *Assertion Operator*    *Assertion Expected*
| Get Title                                           equal                 Page Title
| Get Title                                           ^=                    Page
| Get Style    //*[@id="div-element"]      width      &gt;                     100
| Get Title                                           matches               \\w+\\s\\w+
| Get Title                                           validate              value == "Login Page"
| Get Title                                           evaluate              value if value == "some value" else "something else"


= Implicit waiting =

Browser library and Playwright have many mechanisms to help in waiting for elements.
Playwright will auto-wait before performing actions on elements.
Please see [https://playwright.dev/docs/actionability/ | Auto-waiting on Playwright documentation]
for more information.

On top of Playwright auto-waiting Browser assertions will wait and retry
for specified time before failing any `Assertions`.
Time is specified in Browser library initialization with ``retry_assertions_for``.

Browser library also includes explicit waiting keywords such as `Wait for Elements State`
if more control for waiting is needed.

= Experimental: Re-using same node process =

Browser library integrated nodejs and python. The NodeJS side can be also executed as a standalone process.
Browser libraries running on the same machine can talk to that instead of starting new node processes.
This can speed execution when running tests parallel.
To start node side run on the directory when the Browser package is
``PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=0 node Browser/wrapper/index.js PORT``.

``PORT`` is the port you want to use for the node process.
To execute tests then with pabot for example do ``ROBOT_FRAMEWORK_BROWSER_NODE_PORT=PORT pabot ..``.

= Experimental: Provide parameters to node process =

Browser library is integrated with NodeJSand and Python. Browser library starts a node process, to communicate
Playwright API in NodeJS side. It is possible to provide parameters for the started node process by defining
ROBOT_FRAMEWORK_BROWSER_NODE_DEBUG_OPTIONS environment variable, before starting the test execution. Example:
``ROBOT_FRAMEWORK_BROWSER_NODE_DEBUG_OPTIONS=--inspect;robot path/to/tests``.
There can be multiple arguments defined in the environment variable and arguments must be separated with comma.

= Scope Setting =

Some keywords which manipulates library settings have a scope argument.
With that scope argument one can set the "live time" of that setting.
Available Scopes are: `Global`, `Suite` and `Test`/`Task`
See `Scope`.
Is a scope finished, this scoped setting, like timeout, will no longer be used.

Live Times:
- A `Global` scope will live forever until it is overwritten by another `Global` scope. Or locally temporarily overridden by a more narrow scope.
- A `Suite` scope will locally override the `Global` scope and live until the end of the Suite within it is set, or if it is overwritten by a later setting with `Global` or same scope. Children suite does inherit the setting from the parent suite but also may have its own local `Suite` setting that then will be inherited to its children suites.
- A `Test` or `Task` scope will be inherited from its parent suite but when set, lives until the end of that particular test or task.

A new set higher order scope will always remove the lower order scope which may be in charge.
So the setting of a `Suite` scope from a test, will set that scope to the robot file suite where that test is and removes the `Test` scope that may have been in place.

= Extending Browser library with a JavaScript module =

Browser library can be extended with JavaScript. The module must be in CommonJS format that Node.js uses.
You can translate your ES6 module to Node.js CommonJS style with Babel. Many other languages
can be also translated to modules that can be used from Node.js. For example TypeScript, PureScript and
ClojureScript just to mention few.

| async function myGoToKeyword(url, args, page, logger, playwright) {
|   logger(args.toString())
|   playwright.coolNewFeature()
|   return await page.goto(url);
| }

Functions can contain any number of arguments and arguments may have default values.

There are some reserved arguments that are not accessible from Robot Framework side.
They are injected to the function if they are in the arguments:

``page``: [https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page|the playwright Page object].

``context``: [https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsercontext|the playwright BrowserContext object].

``browser``: [https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browser|the playwright Browser object].

``args``: the rest of values from Robot Framework keyword call ``*args``.

``logger``: callback function that takes strings as arguments and writes them to robot log. Can be called multiple times.

``playwright``: playwright module (* from 'playwright'). Useful for integrating with Playwright features that Browser library doesn't support with it's own keywords. [https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-playwright| API docs]

also argument name ``self`` can not be used.

== Example module.js ==

| async function myGoToKeyword(pageUrl, page) {
|   await page.goto(pageUrl);
|   return await page.title();
| }
| exports.__esModule = true;
| exports.myGoToKeyword = myGoToKeyword;

== Example Robot Framework side ==

| *** Settings ***
| Library   Browser  jsextension=${CURDIR}/module.js
|
| *** Test Cases ***
| Hello
|   New Page
|   ${title}=  myGoToKeyword  https://playwright.dev
|   Should be equal  ${title}  Playwright

Also selector syntax can be extended with a custom selector using a js module

== Example module keyword for custom selector registering ==

| async function registerMySelector(playwright) {
| playwright.selectors.register("myselector", () =&gt; ({
|    // Returns the first element matching given selector in the root's subtree.
|    query(root, selector) {
|       return root.querySelector(`a[data-title="${selector}"]`);
|     },
|
|     // Returns all elements matching given selector in the root's subtree.
|     queryAll(root, selector) {
|       return Array.from(root.querySelectorAll(`a[data-title="${selector}"]`));
|     }
| }));
| return 1;
| }
| exports.__esModule = true;
| exports.registerMySelector = registerMySelector;

= Plugins =

Browser library offers plugins as a way to modify and add library keywords and modify some of the internal
functionality without creating a new library or hacking the source code. See plugin API
[https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-browser/blob/main/docs/plugins/README.md | documentation] for
further details.

= Language =

Browser library offers possibility to translate keyword names and documentation to new language. If language
is defined, Browser library will search from
[https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#module-search-path | module search path]
Python packages starting with `robotframework_browser_translation` by using
[https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/creating-and-discovering-plugins/ | Python pluging API]. Library
is using naming convention to find Python plugins.

The package must implement single API call, ``get_language`` without any arguments. Method must return a
dictionary containing two keys: ``language`` and ``path``. The language key value defines which language
the package contains. Also value should match (case insensitive) the library ``language`` import parameter.
The path parameter value should be full path to the translation file.

== Translation file ==

The file name or extension is not important, but data must be in [https://www.json.org/json-en.html | json]
format. The keys of json are the methods names, not the keyword names, which implements keywords. Value of
key is json object which contains two keys: ``name`` and ``doc``. The ``name`` key contains the keyword
translated name and `doc` contains translated documentation. Providing doc and name are optional, example
translation json file can only provide translations to keyword names or only to documentation. But it is
always recommended to provide translation to both name and doc. Special key ``__intro__`` is for class level
documentation and ``__init__`` is for init level documentation. These special values ``name`` can not be
translated, instead ``name`` should be kept the same.

== Generating template translation file ==

Template translation file, with English language can be created by running:
`rfbrowser translation /path/to/translation.json` command. Command does not provide translations to other
languages, it only provides easy way to create full list keywords and their documentation in correct
format. It is also possible to add keywords from library plugins and js extensions by providing
`--plugings` and `--jsextension` arguments to command. Example:
`rfbrowser translation --plugings myplugin.SomePlugin --jsextension /path/ot/jsplugin.js /path/to/translation.json`

Example project for translation can be found from
[https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-browser-translation-fi | robotframework-browser-translation-fi]

<doc>Browser library can be taken into use with optional arguments:

| =Argument=                        | =Description= |
| ``auto_closing_level``            | Configure context and page automatic closing. Default is ``TEST``, for more details, see `AutoClosingLevel` |
| ``auto_delete_passed_tracing``    | If ``auto_closing_level`` is set to ``SUITE`` or ``TEST`` and ``tracing`` of `New Context` active, traces of passed tests or suites, depending on the context scope, not be saved. Also temp files will all be deleted after the whole execution ends. |
| ``enable_playwright_debug``       | Enable low level debug information from the playwright to playwright-log.txt file. For more details, see `PlaywrightLogTypes`. |
| ``enable_presenter_mode``         | Automatic highlights the interacted components, slowMo and a small pause at the end. Can be enabled by giving True or can be customized by giving a dictionary: `{"duration": "2 seconds", "width": "2px", "style": "dotted", "color": "blue"}` Where `duration` is time format in Robot Framework format, defaults to 2 seconds. `width` is width of the marker in pixels, defaults the `2px`. `style` is the style of border, defaults to `dotted`. `color` is the color of the marker, defaults to `blue`. By default, the call banner keyword is also enabled unless explicitly disabled. |
| ``external_browser_executable``   | Dict mapping name of browser to path of executable of a browser. Will make opening new browsers of the given type use the set executablePath. Currently only configuring of `chromium` to a separate executable (chrome, chromium and Edge executables all work with recent versions) works. |
| ``highlight_on_failure``          | If set to ``True``, will highlight the element in the screenshot when a keyword fails, by highlighting the selector used in the failed keyword. If set to ``False``, will not highlight the element. |
| ``jsextension``                   | Path to Javascript modules exposed as extra keywords. The modules must be in CommonJS. It can either be a single path, a comma-separated lists of path or a real list of strings |
| ``language``                      | Defines language which is used to translate keyword names and documentation. |
| ``playwright_process_host``       | Hostname / Host address which should be used when spawning the Playwright process. Defaults to 127.0.0.1. |
| ``playwright_process_port``       | Experimental reusing of playwright process. ``playwright_process_port`` is preferred over environment variable ``ROBOT_FRAMEWORK_BROWSER_NODE_PORT``. See `Experimental: Re-using same node process` for more details. |
| ``plugins``                       | Allows extending the Browser library with external Python classes. Can either be a single class/module, a comma-separated list or a real list of strings |
| ``retry_assertions_for``          | Timeout for retrying assertions on keywords before failing the keywords. This timeout starts counting from the first failure. Global ``timeout`` will still be in effect. This allows stopping execution faster to assertion failure when element is found fast. |
| ``run_on_failure``                | Sets the keyword to execute in case of a failing Browser keyword. It can be the name of any keyword. If the keyword has arguments those must be separated with two spaces for example ``My keyword \ arg1 \ arg2``. If no extra action should be done after a failure, set it to ``None`` or any other robot falsy value. Run on failure is not applied when library methods are executed directly from Python. |
| ``selector_prefix``               | Prefix for all selectors. This is useful when you need to use add an iframe selector before each selector. |
| ``show_keyword_call_banner``      | If set to ``True``, will show a banner with the keyword name and arguments before the keyword is executed at the bottom of the page. If set to ``False``, will not show the banner. If set to None, which is the default, will show the banner only if the presenter mode is enabled. `Get Page Source` and `Take Screenshot` will not show the banner, because that could negatively affect your test cases/tasks. This feature may be super helpful when you are debugging your tests and using tracing from `New Context` or `Video recording` features. |
| ``strict``                        | If keyword selector points multiple elements and keywords should interact with one element, keyword will fail if ``strict`` mode is true. Strict mode can be changed individually in keywords or by ``Set Strict Mode`` keyword. |
| ``timeout``                       | Timeout for keywords that operate on elements. The keywords will wait for this time for the element to appear into the page. Defaults to "10s" =&gt; 10 seconds. |
| ``tracing_group_mode``            | Defines how Robot Framework keyword calls are logged in Playwright trace log. Default is `Full`. For more details, see `TracingGroupMode`. |</doc>

<doc>Add a handler function which will activate when `selector` is visible and click.

The handler will click the element indicated by `click_selector`.

When testing a web page, sometimes unexpected overlays, example "Accept Cookies" dialog
might appear and block the interaction with the page, like `Click` keyword. These
overlays can be problematic to handle, because they might appear randomly in the page.
This keyword allows to create automatic method, which will close those overlays by
clicking the element indicated by ``click_selector``. Handler is activated when
element indicated by ``selector`` is visible. For further information, see Playwright's
[https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-add-locator-handler|addLocatorHandler]
method.

| =Arguments= | =Description= |
| ``selector`` | Is the selector to the element which indicated that locator handler should be called. |
| ``noWaitAfter`` | By default, after calling the handler Playwright will wait until the overlay becomes hidden, and only then library will continue with the action/assertion that triggered the handler. This option allows to opt-out of this behavior, so that overlay can stay visible after the handler has run. |
| ``times`` | Is the number of times to how often locator handler is is called. None is unlimited. |
| ``click_selector`` | Is the selector to the element to be clicked. |
| ``click_clickCount`` | Is the number of times to click the element. |
| ``click_delay`` | Time to wait between mousedown and mouseup in milliseconds. Defaults to 0. |
| ``click_force`` | Whether to bypass checks and dispatch the event directly. Defaults to false. |

The arguments `click_selector`, `click_clickCount`, `click_delay` and `click_force` are same as
`Click` keyword. The `selector`, `noWaitAfter` and `times` are for the locator handler. The
handler is tied to the active page, if there is need to add handler to another page, this keyword
needs to be called separately for each page. If the `times` argument is set to positive value,
the locator handler is removed after the handler has been called the specified number of times.

Example add locator handler to click button with id="ButtonInOverlay" when id=Overlay is visible:
| `New Page`    ${URL}
| `Add Locator Handler Click`    id=Overlay    id=ButtonInOverlay     # Add locator handler to page
| `Type Text`    id:username    user    # If element with id=Overlay appears, the handler will click the button id=ButtonInOverlay
| `Type Text`    id:password    password    # Or if overlay is visible here, then handler is called here
| `Click`    id:login
| `Remove Locator Handler`    id:button    # Removes the locator handler from page</doc>

<doc>Add a handler function which will activate when `selector` is visible and performs handler specification.

When element indicated by `selector` is visible, the handler will perform the actions specified
in the `handler_spec`.

| =Arguments= | =Description= |
| ``selector`` | Is the selector to the element which indicated that locator handler should be called. |
| ``noWaitAfter`` | By default, after calling the handler Playwright will wait until the overlay becomes hidden, and only then library will continue with the action/assertion that triggered the handler. This option allows to opt-out of this behavior, so that overlay can stay visible after the handler has run. |
| ``times`` | Is the number of times to how often locator handler is is called. None is unlimited. |
| ``handler_spec`` | Is a list of dictionaries which defines the actions to be performed. |

The `handler_spec` is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary defines one action.
The dictionary must contain the key `action` which defines the action to be
performed. The action can be one of the following:
[https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator#locator-click|click],
[https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator#locator-fill|fill],
[https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator#locator-check|check] and
[https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator#locator-uncheck|uncheck]. Action is also case
insensitive. The dictionary must also contain key `selector` which defines the element
to be interacted with. The `fill` action must also contain the key `value` which defines
the value to be filled in the element. Additional keys are passed to the action as
keyword arguments. Example for the
[https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator#locator-click|click] action refer to the Playwright's
documentation which options are possible.

The `selector`, `noWaitAfter` and `times` are for the locator handler
[https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-add-locator-handler|method].
The handler is tied to the active page, if there is need to add handler to another page, this keyword
needs to be called separately for each page. If the `times` argument is set to positive value,
the locator handler is removed after the handler has been called the specified number of times.

Running the handler will alter your page state mid-test. For example it will change the currently
focused element and move the mouse. Make sure that keywords that run after the handler are
self-contained and do not rely on the focus and mouse state being unchanged.

Please note that the automatic argument conversion is not done for the `handler_spec` dictionary.
This is because Robot Framework does not convert values inside the dictionary that are actually
arguments to a separate Playwright API call. Therefore the user is responsible to convert
the values to the correct type. Example if timeout is needed, the value must be converted to a number
in Robot Framework test data side.

Example adds locator handler to fill input id=overlayInput with value "Hello" and click
element id=OverlayCloseButton when id=Overlay is visible:
| `New Page`    ${URL}
| VAR    &amp;{handler_spec_fill}
| ...    action=Fill
| ...    selector=id=overlayInput
| ...    value=Hello
| VAR    &amp;{handler_spec_click}
| ...    action=click
| ...    selector=id=OverlayCloseButton
| `Add Locator Handler Custom`
| ...    id=overlay
| ...    [${handler_spec_fill}, ${handler_spec_click}]
| `Type Text`    id:username    user    # If element with id=Overlay appears, the handler will click the button id=ButtonInOverlay
| `Type Text`    id:password    password    # Or if overlay is visible here, then handler is called here
| `Click`    id:login

Example with click and different options and types:
| VAR    &amp;{handler_spec}
| ...    action=CLICK    # Action is case insensitive
| ...    selector=id=OverlayCloseButton
| ...    button=left
| ...    clickCount=${1}
| ...    delay=${0.1}
| ...    force=${True}
| Add Locator Handler Custom    id=overlay    [${handler_spec}]

The keyword can only handle click, fill, check and uncheck Playwright API calls. If there is a
need for more complex interactions, it is recommended to create a custom js extension to handle
the interactions.

Example:
| async function customLocatorHandler(locator, pageLocator, clickLocator, page) {
|     console.log("Adding custom locator handler for: " + locator);
|     const pageLocator = page.locator(locator).first();
|     await page.addLocatorHandler(
|         pageLocator,
|         async () =&gt; {
|             console.log("Handling custom locator: " + clickLocator);
|             // More complex interactions can be added here
|             await page.locator(clickLocator).click();
|         }
|     );
| }
| exports.__esModule = true;
| exports.customLocatorHandler = customLocatorHandler;</doc>

| =Arguments= | =Description= |
| ``selector`` | Selector element to click. See the `Finding elements` section for details about the selectors. |
| ``button`` | Defaults to ``left`` if invalid. |
| ``*modifiers`` | Modifier keys to press. Ensures that only these modifiers are pressed during the click, and then restores current modifiers back. If not specified, currently pressed modifiers are used. Modifiers can be specified in any order, and multiple modifiers can be specified. Valid modifier keys are ``Control``, ``Alt``, ``Shift`` and ``Meta``. Due to the fact that the argument `*modifiers` is a positional only argument, all preceding keyword arguments have to be specified as positional arguments before `*modifiers`. |
| ``clickCount`` | Defaults to 1. |
| ``delay`` | Time to wait between mouse-down and mouse-up. Defaults to 0. |
| ``position_x`` ``position_y`` | A point to click relative to the top-left corner of element bounding-box. Only positive values within the bounding-box are allowed. If not specified, clicks to some visible point of the element. |
| ``force`` | Set to True to skip Playwright's Actionability checks (https://playwright.dev/docs/actionability). |
| ``noWaitAfter`` | Deprecated. This option will default to true in the future. Actions that initiate navigation, are waiting for these navigation to happen and for pages to start loading. You can opt out of waiting via setting this flag. You would only need this option in the exceptional cases such as navigating to inaccessible pages. Defaults to ``False``. |
| ``trial`` | When set, this method only performs the actionability checks and skips the action. Defaults to false. Useful to wait until the element is ready for the action without performing it. |

Arguments ``clickCount``, ``delay``, ``position_x``, ``position_y``, ``force``, ``noWaitAfter`` and ``trial`` are named-only arguments and must be specified using their names..

Keyword uses strict mode, see `Finding elements` for more details about strict mode.

<doc>Connect to a Playwright browser server via playwright websocket or Chrome DevTools Protocol.

See `Launch Browser Server` for more information about how to launch a playwright browser server.

See `Browser, Context and Page` for more information about Browser and related concepts.

Returns a stable identifier for the connected browser.

| =Argument=     | =Description= |
| ``wsEndpoint`` | Address to connect to. Either ``ws://`` or ``http://`` if cdp is used. |
| ``browser``    | Opens the specified browser. Defaults to ``chromium``. |
| ``use_cdp``    | Connect to browser via Chrome DevTools Protocol. Defaults to False. Works only with Chromium based browsers. |
| ``timeout``    | Maximum time in Robot Framework time format to wait for the connection to be established. Defaults to 30 seconds. Pass 0 to disable timeout. |

To Connect to a Browser viw Chrome DevTools Protocol, the browser must be started with this protocol enabled.
This typically done by starting a Chrome browser with the argument ``--remote-debugging-port=9222`` or similar.
When the browser is running with activated CDP, it is possible to connect to it either with websockets (``ws://``)
or via HTTP (``http://``). The HTTP connection can be used when ``use_cdp`` is set to True.
A typical address for a CDP connection is ``http://127.0.0.1:9222``.

<doc>Download given url content.

| =Arguments= | =Description= |
| ``url`` | URL to the file that shall be downloaded. |
| ``saveAs`` | Path where the file shall be saved persistently. If empty, generated unique path (GUID) is used and file is deleted when the context is closed. |
| ``wait_for_finished`` | If set to ``False`` keyword returns immediately after the download is started. Defaults to ``True``. |
| ``download_timeout`` | Timeout for the download itself if ``wait_for_finished`` is set to ``True``. By default no timeout is set. |

Keyword returns dictionary of type `DownloadInfo`.

Example:
| {
|   "saveAs": "/tmp/robotframework-browser/downloads/2f1b3b7c-1b1b-4b1b-9b1b-1b1b1b1b1b1b",
|   "suggestedFilename": "downloaded_file.txt"
|   "state": "finished",
|   "downloadID": None,
| }

If the download should be started by an interaction with an element on the page,
`Promise To Wait For Download` keyword may be a better choice.

The keyword `New Browser` has a ``downloadsPath`` setting which can be used to set the default download directory.
If `saveAs` is set to a relative path, the file will be saved relative to the browser's ``downloadsPath`` setting or if that is not set, relative to the
Playwright's working directory. If ``saveAs`` is set to an absolute path, the file will be saved to that absolute path independent of ``downloadsPath``.

To enable downloads context's ``acceptDownloads`` needs to be true.
This keyword requires that there is currently an open page. The keyword uses
the current pages local state (cookies, sessionstorage, localstorage) for the
download to avoid authentication problems.

Example:
| ${file_object}=    `Download`    ${url}
| ${actual_size}=    Get File Size    ${file_object.saveAs}

Example 2:
| ${href}=          `Get Property`    text="Download File"    href
| `Download`    ${href}    saveAs=${OUTPUT DIR}/downloads/downloaded_file.txt
| File Should Exist    ${OUTPUT DIR}/downloads/downloaded_file.txt

If given a selector, a function is necessary, with an argument to capture the elementHandle. For example ``(element) =&gt; document.activeElement === element`` See the `Finding elements` section for details about the selectors. |
| ``*function`` | A valid javascript function or a javascript function body. These arguments can be used to write readable multiline JavaScript. |
| ``arg`` | an additional argument that can be handed over to the JavaScript function. This argument must be JSON serializable. ElementHandles are not supported. |
| ``all_elements`` | defines if only the single elementHandle found by ``selector`` is handed over to the function or if set to ``True`` all found elements are handed over as array. |

Example with ``all_elements=True``:
|  ${texts}=    Evaluate JavaScript    button
|  ...    (elements, arg) =&gt; {
|  ...        let text = []
|  ...            for (e of elements) {
|  ...                console.log(e.innerText)
|  ...                text.push(e.innerText)
|  ...            }
|  ...        text.push(arg)
|  ...        return text
|  ...    }
|  ...    all_elements=True
|  ...    arg=Just another Text

Keyword uses strict mode if ``all_elements`` is ``False``. See `Finding elements` for more details
about strict mode.

<doc>Fills the given secret from ``variable_name`` into the
text field found by ``selector``.


| =Arguments= | =Description= |
| ``secret`` | The secret string that should be filled into the text field. |
| ``selector`` | Selector of the text field. See the `Finding elements` section for details about the selectors. |
| ``force`` | Set to True to skip Playwright's [https://playwright.dev/docs/actionability | Actionability checks]. |


This keyword does not log secret in Robot Framework logs, when
keyword resolves the ``secret`` variable internally.
When ``secret`` variable is prefixed with `$`, without the curly braces,
library will resolve the corresponding Robot Framework variable.

If ``secret`` variable is prefixed with `%`, library will resolve
corresponding environment variable. Example `$Password`` will
resolve to ``${Password}`` Robot Framework variable.
Also ``%ENV_PWD`` will resolve to ``%{ENV_PWD}`` environment variable.

*Using normal Robot Framework variables like ``${password}`` will not work!*

*Normal plain text will not work.*
If you want to use plain text, use `Fill Text` keyword instead.

This keyword will also work with a give cryptographic cipher text, that has been
encrypted by Crypto library.
See [https://github.com/Snooz82/robotframework-crypto | Crypto Library] for more details.

If ``enable_playwright_debug`` is enabled in the library import,
secret will be always visible as plain text in the playwright debug
logs, regardless of the Robot Framework log level.

Keyword uses strict mode, see `Finding elements` for more details about strict mode.

See `Fill Text` for other details.

Example:
| `Fill Secret`    input#username_field    $username    # Keyword resolves variable value from Robot Framework variables
| `Fill Secret`    input#username_field    %username    # Keyword resolves variable value from environment variables

<doc>Clears and fills the given ``txt`` into the text field found by ``selector``.

This method waits for an element matching the ``selector`` to appear,
waits for actionability checks, focuses the element, fills it and
triggers an input event after filling.

If the element matching selector is not an &lt;input&gt;, &lt;textarea&gt; or
[contenteditable] element, this method throws an error. Note that
you can pass an empty string as ``txt`` to clear the input field.

<doc>Gets elements size and location as an object ``{x: float, y: float, width: float, height: float}``.

Alternatively you can select a single attribute of the bounding box by setting the ``key`` argument.

If an element is hidden and has no bounding box, the keyword will fail.
Depending on the method used to make an element invisible, an element might still have a bounding box which can be retrieved.
To allow also hidden elements without a bounding box, set ``allow_hidden`` to ``True``,
which results in a return value of `None` in case of no bounding box.

| =Arguments= | =Description= |
| ``selector`` | Selector from which shall be retrieved. See the `Finding elements` section for details about the selectors. |
| ``key`` | Optionally filters the returned values. If keys is set to ``ALL`` (default) it will return the BoundingBox as Dictionary, otherwise it will just return the single value selected by the key. Note: If a single value is retrieved, an assertion does *not* need a ``validate`` combined with a cast of ``value``. |
| ``assertion_operator`` | See `Assertions` for further details. Defaults to None. |
| ``assertion_expected`` | Expected value for the counting |
| ``message`` | overrides the default error message for assertion. |
| ``allow_hidden`` | (named only) If True, hidden elements are not causing a failure and will return `None`. Otherwise hidden element will fail. Defaults to False. |

Keyword uses strict mode, see `Finding elements` for more details about strict mode.

Optionally asserts that the value matches the specified assertion. See
`Assertions` for further details for the assertion arguments. By default assertion
is not done.

Example use:

<doc>Allows locating elements by their features.

Selection strategies can be several Playwright strategies like AltText or Label.
See [https://playwright.dev/docs/locators|Playwright Locators] for more information.

| =Arguments= | =Description= |
| ``locator_type`` | SelectionStrategy to be used. Refers to Playwrights ``page.getBy***`` functions. See https://playwright.dev/docs/locators |
| ``text`` | Text to locate the element for. |
| ``exact`` | Whether to find an exact match: case-sensitive and whole-string. Default to false. Ignored when locating by a regular expression. Note that exact match still trims whitespace. This has no effect if RegExp is used or if TestID is used as strategy. |
| ``all_elements`` | If True, returns all matched elements as a list. |

This keywords implements the following Playwright functions:
- [https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-get-by-alt-text|page.getByAltText]
- [https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-get-by-label|page.getByLabel]
- [https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-get-by-placeholder|page.getByPlaceholder]
- [https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-get-by-test-id|page.getByTestId]
- [https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-get-by-text|page.getByText]
- [https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-get-by-title|page.getByTitle]

``page.getByRole`` is supported by `Get Element By Role` keyword.

If an element shall be fetched from an iframe, a selector prefix must be set using `Set Selector Prefix` keyword including ``&gt;&gt;&gt;`` as ending.

<doc>Returns a reference to Playwright [https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator|Locator]
for the matched element by ``role`` or a list of references if ``all_elements`` is set to ``True``.

Allows locating elements by their [https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#roles|ARIA role],
[https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#aria-attributes|ARIA attributes] and
[https://w3c.github.io/accname/#dfn-accessible-name|accessible name].


Consider the following DOM structure.

| &lt;h3&gt;Sign up&lt;/h3&gt;
| &lt;label&gt;
|   &lt;input type="checkbox" /&gt; Subscribe
| &lt;/label&gt;
| &lt;br/&gt;
| &lt;button&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;

You can locate each element by it's implicit role:
| ${heading}    Get Element By Role    heading    name=Sign up
| ${checkbox}   Get Element By Role    checkbox    name=Subscribe
| ${button}     Get Element By Role    button    name=/submit/i

| =Arguments= | =Description= |
| ``all_elements`` | If True, returns all matched elements as a list. |
| ``role`` | Role from which shall be retrieved. |
| ``checked`` | An attribute that is usually set by aria-checked or native &lt;input type=checkbox&gt; controls. |
| ``disabled`` | An attribute that is usually set by aria-disabled or disabled. |
| ``exact`` | Whether name is matched exactly: case-sensitive and whole-string. Defaults to false. Ignored when name is a regular expression. Note that exact match still trims whitespace. |
| ``expanded`` | An attribute that is usually set by aria-expanded. |
| ``include_hidden`` | Option that controls whether hidden elements are matched. By default, only non-hidden elements, as defined by ARIA, are matched by role selector. |
| ``level`` | A number attribute that is usually present for roles heading, list item, row, treeitem, with default values for &lt;h1&gt;-&lt;h6&gt; elements. |
| ``name`` | Option to match the accessible name. By default, matching is case-insensitive and searches for a substring, use exact to control this behavior. |
| ``pressed`` | An attribute that is usually set by aria-pressed. |
| ``selected`` | An attribute that is usually set by aria-selected. |

If an element shall be fetched from an iframe, a selector prefix must be set using `Set Selector Prefix` keyword including ``&gt;&gt;&gt;`` as ending.

<doc>Get the active states from the element found by ``selector``.

This Keyword returns a list of states that are valid for the selected element.


| =Arguments= | =Description= |
| ``selector`` | Selector of the corresponding object. See the `Finding elements` section for details about the selectors. |
| ``assertion_operator`` | See `Assertions` for further details. Defaults to None. |
| ``*assertion_expected`` | Expected states |
| ``message`` | overrides the default error message for assertion. |
| ``return_names`` | If set to ``False`` the keyword does return an IntFlag object (`ElementState`) instead of a list. `ElementState` may contain multiple states at the same time. Defaults to ``True``. |

Optionally asserts that the state matches the specified assertion. See
`Assertions` for further details for the assertion arguments. By default, assertion
is not done.

This keyword internally works with Python IntFlag.
Flags can be processed using bitwise operators like &amp; (bitwise AND) and | (bitwise OR).
When using the assertion operators ``then``, ``evaluate`` or ``validate`` the ``value``
contain the states as `ElementState`.

Example:
| `Get Element States`    h1    validate    value &amp; visible   # Fails in case of an invisible element
| `Get Element States`    h1    then    value &amp; (visible | hidden)  # Returns either ``['visible']`` or ``['hidden']``
| `Get Element States`    h1    then    bool(value &amp; visible)  # Returns ``${True}`` if element is visible

The most typical use case would be to verify if an element contains a specific state or multiple states.

Example:
| `Get Element States`    id=checked_elem      *=    checked
| `Get Element States`    id=checked_elem      not contains    checked
| `Get Element States`    id=invisible_elem    contains    hidden    attached
| `Get Element States`    id=disabled_elem     contains    visible    disabled    readonly

Elements do return the positive and negative values if applicable.
As example, a checkbox does return either ``checked`` or ``unchecked`` while a text input
element has none of those two states.
Select elements have also either ``selected`` or ``unselected``.

The state of ``animating`` will be set if an element is not considered ``stable``
within 300 ms.

If an element is not attached to the dom, so it can not be found within 250ms
it is marked as ``detached`` as the only state.

``stable`` state is not returned, because it would cause too high delay in that keyword.

Keyword uses strict mode, see `Finding elements` for more details about strict mode.

<doc>Returns a list of page ids based on the context and browser selection.
See `Browser, Context and Page` for more information about Page and related concepts.

``ALL`` and ``ANY`` are synonyms.
``ACTIVE`` and ``CURRENT`` are also synonyms.

| =Arguments= | =Description= |
| ``page``    | The page to get the ids from. ``ALL`` Returns all page ids as a list. ``ACTIVE`` Returns the id of the active page as a list. |
| ``context`` | The context id or selection to get the page ids from. ``ALL`` Page ids from all contexts shall be fetched. ``ACTIVE`` Only page ids from the active context shall be fetched. |
| ``browser`` | The browser id or selection to get the page ids from. ``ALL`` Page ids from all open browsers shall be fetched. ``ACTIVE`` Only page ids from the active browser shall be fetched. |


Example:
| Test Case
|     `New Page`    https://www.imbus.de
|     `New Page`    https://www.reaktor.com
|     ${current_page}=   `Get Page IDs`    ACTIVE    ACTIVE    ACTIVE
|     Log                Current page ID is: ${current_page}[0]
|     ${all_pages}=      `Get Page IDs`    CURRENT   CURRENT   ALL
|     Log Many           These are all Page IDs    @{all_pages}

Example to count open pages of a specific context:
| Test Case
|    `New Browser`    firefox
|    ${context}=    `New Context`
|    `New Page`    https://www.imbus.de
|    `New Page`    https://www.op.fi
|    `New Context`
|    `New Page`    https://www.robocon.io
|    ${page_count}=    `Get Page IDs`    ALL    ${context}    ALL    then    len(value)
|    Should Be Equal As Integers    ${page_count}    2

The ACTIVE page of the ACTIVE context of the ACTIVE Browser is the ``Current`` Page.

<doc>Returns the Web Element that has the same column index and same row index as the selected elements.

| =Arguments= | =Description= |
| ``table`` | selector must select the ``&lt;table&gt;`` element that contains both selected elements |
| ``column`` | selector can select any ``&lt;th&gt;`` or ``&lt;td&gt;`` element or one of their descendants. |
| ``row`` | selector can select any ``&lt;tr&gt;`` element or one of their descendant like ``&lt;td&gt;`` elements. |

``column`` and ``row`` can also consume index numbers instead of selectors.
Indexes are starting from ``0`` and ``-1`` is specific for the last element.

Selectors for ``column`` and ``row`` are directly appended to ``table`` selector like this: ``f"{table} &gt;&gt; {row}" .``

       Keyword uses strict mode, see `Finding elements` for more details about strict mode.

       Optionally asserts that the text matches the specified assertion. See `Assertions`
       for further details for the assertion arguments. By default, assertion is not done.

       Example:
       | ${text} =    `Get Text`    id=important                            # Returns element text without assertion.
       | ${text} =    `Get Text`    id=important    ==    Important text    # Returns element text with assertion.
       | ${text} =    `Get Text`    //input         ==    root              # Returns input element text with assertion.

<doc>Adds a highlight to elements matched by the ``selector``. Provides a style adjustment.

Returns the number of highlighted elements. Keyword does not fail, if `locator` matched zero elements in
the page. Keyword does not scroll elements to viewport and highlighted element might be outside the
viewport. Use `Scroll To Element` keyword to scroll element in viewport.

| =Arguments= | =Description= |
| ``selector`` | Selectors which shall be highlighted. See the `Finding elements` section for details about the selectors. |
| ``duration`` | Sets for how long the selector shall be highlighted. Defaults to ``5s`` =&gt; 5 seconds. If set to 0 seconds, the highlighting is not deleted. |
| ``width`` | Sets the width of the highlight border. Defaults to 2px. |
| ``style`` | Sets the style of the border. Defaults to dotted. |
| ``color`` | Sets the color of the border. Valid colors i.e. are: ``red``, ``blue``, ``yellow``, ``pink``, ``black`` |
| ``mode`` | Sets the mode of the highlight. Valid modes are: ``border`` (classic mode), ``playwright`` (Playwrights native). If ``playwright`` is used, ``width``, ``style`` and ``color`` is ignored and only one highlighting can happen at the same time. |

Keyword does not fail if selector resolves to multiple elements.

Example:
| `Highlight Elements`    input#login_button    duration=200ms
| ${count} =    `Highlight Elements`    input#login_button    duration=200ms    width=4px    style=solid    color=\#FF00FF
| Should Be Equal    ${count}    ${5}

<doc>Moves the virtual mouse and scrolls to the element found by ``selector``.

This method hovers over an element matching ``selector`` by performing the following steps:
- Find an element match matching ``selector``. If there is none,
  wait until a matching element is attached to the DOM.
- Wait for actionability checks on the matched element, unless ``force`` option is set.
  If the element is detached during the checks, the whole action is retried.
- Scroll the element into view if needed.
- Use `Mouse Move` to hover over the center of the element, or the specified ``position``.


| =Arguments= | =Description= |
| ``selector`` | Selector element to hover. See the `Finding elements` section for details about the selectors. |
| ``position_x`` &amp; ``position_y`` | A point to hover relative to the top-left corner of element bounding box. If not specified, hovers over some visible point of the element. Only positive values within the bounding-box are allowed. |
| ``force`` | Set to True to skip Playwright's [https://playwright.dev/docs/actionability | Actionability checks]. |
| ``*modifiers`` | Modifier keys to press. Ensures that only these modifiers are pressed during the hover, and then restores current modifiers back. If not specified, currently pressed modifiers are used. |

Keyword uses strict mode, see `Finding elements` for more details about strict mode.

Example:
| `Hover`    h1
| `Hover`    h1    10   20    Alt

<doc>Performs an HTTP request in the current browser context

| =Arguments= | =Description= |
| ``url`` | The request url, e.g. ``/api/foo``. |
| ``method`` | The HTTP method for the request. Defaults to GET. |
| ``body`` | The request body. GET requests cannot have a body. If the body can be parsed as JSON, the ``Content-Type`` header for the request will be automatically set to ``application/json``. Defaults to None. |
| ``headers`` | A dictionary of additional request headers. Defaults to None. |

The response is a Python dictionary with following attributes:
  - ``status`` &lt;int&gt; The status code of the response.
  - ``statusText`` &lt;str&gt; Status text corresponding to ``status``, e.g OK or INTERNAL SERVER ERROR. This may not be available for all browser.
  - ``body`` &lt;dict&gt; | &lt;str&gt; The response body. If the body can be parsed as a JSON object,
  it will be returned as Python dictionary, otherwise it is returned as a string.
  - ``headers`` &lt;dict&gt; A dictionary containing all response headers.
  - ``ok`` &lt;bool&gt; Whether the request was successful, i.e. the ``status`` is range 200-299.

Here's an example of using Robot Framework dictionary variables and extended variable syntax to
do assertions on the response object:

| &amp;{res}=             `HTTP`                       /api/endpoint
| Should Be Equal     ${res.status}              200
| Should Be Equal     ${res.body.some_field}     some value

<doc>Input text into page with virtual keyboard.

| =Arguments= | =Description= |
| ``action`` | ``insertText``: Dispatches only input event, does not emit the keydown, keyup or keypress events. ``type``: Sends a keydown, keypress/input, and keyup event for each character in the text. |
| ``input`` | The inputstring to be typed. _No special keys possible._ |
| ``delay`` | Time to wait between key presses in Robot Framework's time format. Defaults to 0. |

*Attention:*
Argument type `int` for 'delay' in milliseconds has been changed to `timedelta` in Browser 14.0.0. Use Robot Framework time format with units instead.


Note: To press a special key, like Control or ArrowDown, use keyboard.press.
Modifier keys DO NOT effect these methods. For testing modifier effects use single key
presses with ``Keyboard Key  press``

Example:
| `Keyboard Input`    insertText    0123456789

<doc>Press a keyboard key on the virtual keyboard or set a key up or down.

| =Arguments= | =Description= |
| ``action`` | Determine whether the key should be released (``up``), hold (``down``) or pressed once (``press``). ``down`` or ``up`` are useful for combinations i.e. with Shift. |
| ``key`` | The key to be pressed. An example of valid keys are: ``F1`` - ``F12``, ``Digit0`` - ``Digit9``, ``KeyA`` - ``KeyZ``, ``Backquote``, ``Minus``, ``Equal``, ``Backslash``, ``Backspace``, ``Tab``, ``Delete``, ``Escape``, ``ArrowDown``, ``End``, ``Enter``, ``Home``, ``Insert``, ``PageDown``, ``PageUp``, ``ArrowRight``, ``ArrowUp`` , etc. |


Useful keys for ``down`` and ``up`` for example are:
``Shift``, ``Control``, ``Alt``, ``Meta``, ``ShiftLeft``

Example execution:
| `Keyboard Key`    press    S
| `Keyboard Key`    down     Shift
| `Keyboard Key`    press    ArrowLeft
| `Keyboard Key`    press    Delete
| `Keyboard Key`    up       Shift

Note: Capital letters don't need to be written by the help of Shift. You can type them in directly.

<doc>Launches a new playwright Browser server with specified options.

Returns a websocket endpoint (wsEndpoint) string that can be used to connect to the server.

| =Arguments= | =Description= |
| ``port`` | Port to use for the browser server. Defaults to 0, which results in a random free port being assigned. |
| ``wsPath`` | If set, Playwright will listen on the given path in addition to the main port. For security, this defaults to an unguessable string. |

Check `New Browser` for the other argument docs.

The launched browser server can be used to connect to it with `Connect To Browser` keyword.
This keyword can also be used from command line with ``rfbrowser launch-browser-server`` command.

see [https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browserserver#browser-server|Playwright documentation] for more information.

| ``name`` | Optional name for the combined report. |
| ``reports`` | Optional report format (default is "v8"). |

The input_folder argument is the base folder where the coverage reports are
located. Keyword will look into each subfolder and if the subfolder
contains "raw" folder, it will use data from the "raw" folder for
combined reports.

The output_folder argument is the folder where the combined report is saved.
If folder does not exist, it is created. If folder exists, it's content
is deleted before report is created.

The output_folder and input_folder must be full paths to the folders.

The config_file argument is optional and can be used to provide a path to a
monocart-coverage-reports options file. For more details see:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/monocart-coverage-reports#config-file

The name argument is optional and can be used to provide a name for the
combined report.

The reports argument is optional and can be used to provide a list of
reporters to create. Default is 'v8'.

The keyword combines only the raw reports. To get raw reports,
`Start Coverage` keyword must be called with `raw=True` argument.
Keyword should be used when there is a need to combine multiple reports
to single report. For example, when tests are run in multiple pages, the
example in below demonstrates how to use the keyword.

Example:
| `New Page`
| `Start Coverage`
| `Go To`    ${LOGIN_URL}
| Test Feature X In The Page
| `Stop Coverage`
| `New Page`
| `Start Coverage`
| `Go To`    ${LOGIN_URL}
| Test Feature Y In The Page
| `Stop Coverage`
| `Merge Coverage Reports`    ${OUTPUT_DIR}/browser/coverage    ${OUTPUT_DIR}/browser/combined-coverage</doc>

<doc>Clicks, presses or releases a mouse button.

| =Arguments= | =Description= |
| ``action`` | Defines if it is a mouseclick (``click``), holding down a button (``down``) or releasing it (``up``). |
| ``x``, ``y`` | Coordinates to move before action is executed. |
| ``button`` | One of ``left``, ``middle`` or ``up``. Defaults to ``left``. |
| ``clickCount`` | Determine how often the button shall be clicked if action is equal to ``click``. Defaults to 1. |
| ``delay`` | Delay in Robot Framework time format between the mousedown and mouseup event. Can only be set if the action is ``click``. |

*Attention:*
Argument type `int` for 'delay' in milliseconds has been changed to `timedelta` in Browser 14.0.0. Use Robot Framework time format instead.
For refactoring just add 'ms' after the delay number.

Delay Example:
| `Mouse Button`    click    100 ms
| `Mouse Button`    click    ${dyn_delay} ms

Moving the mouse between holding down and releasing it, is possible with `Mouse Move`.

Example:
| `Hover`                     "Obstacle"           # Move mouse over the element
| `Mouse Button`              down                 # Press mouse button down
| `Mouse Move Relative To`    "Obstacle"    500    # Drag mouse
| `Mouse Button`              up                   # Release mouse button

<doc>Create a new playwright Browser with specified options.

See `Browser, Context and Page` for more information about Browser and related concepts.

Returns a stable identifier for the created browser.

| =Arguments= | =Description= |
| ``browser`` | Opens the specified [#type-SupportedBrowsers|browser]. Defaults to chromium. |
| ``headless`` | Set to False if you want a GUI. Defaults to True. |
| ``args`` | Additional arguments to pass to the browser instance. The list of Chromium flags can be found [http://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/|here]. Defaults to None. |
| ``channel`` | Allows to operate against the stock Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge browsers. For more details see: [https://playwright.dev/docs/browsers#google-chrome--microsoft-edge|Playwright documentation]. |
| ``chromiumSandbox`` | Enable Chromium sandboxing. Defaults to False. |
| ``devtools`` | Chromium-only Whether to auto-open a Developer Tools panel for each tab. |
| ``downloadsPath`` | If specified, accepted downloads are downloaded into this folder. Otherwise, temporary folder is created and is deleted when browser is closed. Regarding file deletion, see the docs of `Download` and `Promise To Wait For Download`. |
| ``env`` | Specifies environment variables that will be visible to the browser. Dictionary keys are variable names, values are the content. Defaults to None. |
| ``executablePath`` | Path to a browser executable to run instead of the bundled one. If executablePath is a relative path, then it is resolved relative to current working directory. Note that Playwright only works with the bundled Chromium, Firefox or WebKit, use at your own risk. Defaults to None. |
| ``firefoxUserPrefs`` |Firefox user preferences. Learn more about the Firefox user preferences at [https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/about-config-editor-firefox|about:config]. |
| ``handleSIGHUP`` | Close the browser process on SIGHUP. Defaults to True. |
| ``handleSIGINT`` | Close the browser process on Ctrl-C. Defaults to True. |
| ``handleSIGTERM`` | Close the browser process on SIGTERM. Defaults to True. |
| ``ignoreDefaultArgs`` | If True, Playwright does not pass its own configurations args and only uses the ones from args. If a list is given, then filters out the given default arguments. Dangerous option; use with care. Defaults to False. |
| ``proxy`` | Network [#type-Proxy|Proxy] settings. Structure: ``{'server': &lt;str&gt;, 'bypass': &lt;Optional[str]&gt;, 'username': &lt;Optional[str]&gt;, 'password': &lt;Optional[str]&gt;}`` |
| ``reuse_existing`` | If set to True, an existing browser instance, that matches the same arguments, will be reused. If no same configured Browser exist, a new one is started. Defaults to True. |
| ``slowMo`` | Slows down Playwright operations by the specified amount of seconds or `timedelta`. Useful so that you can see what is going on. Defaults to no delay. |
| ``timeout`` | Maximum time in Robot Framework time format to wait for the browser instance to start. Defaults to 30 seconds. Pass 0 to disable timeout. |

<doc>Create a new BrowserContext with specified options.

See `Browser, Context and Page` for more information about BrowserContext.

Returns a stable identifier for the created context
that can be used in `Switch Context`.


| =Arguments=              | =Description= |
| ``acceptDownloads``      | Whether to automatically download all the attachments. Defaults to True where all the downloads are accepted. |
| ``baseURL``              | When using `Go To`, `Wait For Request`, `Wait For Response` or `Wait For Navigation` it takes the base URL in consideration by using the URL() constructor for building the corresponding URL. Unset by default. Examples: ``baseURL=http://localhost:3000`` and navigating to ``/bar.html`` results in ``http://localhost:3000/bar.html``. ``baseURL=http://localhost:3000/foo/`` and navigating to ``./bar.html`` results in ``http://localhost:3000/foo/bar.html``. ``baseURL=http://localhost:3000/foo`` (without trailing slash) and navigating to ``./bar.html`` results in ``http://localhost:3000/bar.html``. |
| ``bypassCSP``            | Toggles bypassing page's Content-Security-Policy. Defaults to False. |
| ``clientCertificates``   | Specifies a client certificate for mTLS authentication, for example ``clientCertificates=[{'origin': 'https://playwright.dev', 'pfxPath': 'certificate.p12', 'passphrase': 'password'}]``. *NOTE:* The origin needs to be exact whithout any path. |
| ``colorScheme``          | Emulates `'prefers-colors-scheme'` media feature, supported values are `'light'`, `'dark'`, `'no-preference'`. |
| ``defaultBrowserType``   | If no browser is open and `New Context` opens a new browser with defaults, it now uses this setting. Very useful together with `Get Device` keyword. |
| ``deviceScaleFactor``    | Specify device scale factor (can be thought of as dpr). Defaults to ``1``. |
| ``extraHTTPHeaders``     | A dictionary containing additional HTTP headers to be sent with every request. All header values must be strings. |
| ``forcedColors``         | Emulates `forced-colors` media feature, supported values are `active` and `none`. |
| ``geolocation``          | A dictionary containing ``latitude`` and ``longitude`` or ``accuracy`` to emulate. If ``latitude`` or ``longitude`` is not specified, the device geolocation won't be overriden. |
| ``hasTouch``             | Specifies if viewport supports touch events. Defaults to False. |
| ``httpCredentials``      | Credentials for [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication|HTTP authentication]. |
| ``ignoreHTTPSErrors``    | Whether to ignore HTTPS errors during navigation. Defaults to False. |
| ``isMobile``             | Whether the meta viewport tag is taken into account and touch events are enabled. Defaults to False. |
| ``javaScriptEnabled``    | Whether or not to enable JavaScript in the context. Defaults to True. |
| ``locale``               | Specify user locale, for example ``en-GB``, ``de-DE``, etc. |
| ``offline``              | Toggles browser's offline mode. Defaults to False. |
| ``permissions``          | A list containing permissions to grant to all pages in this context. All permissions that are not listed here will be automatically denied. |
| ``proxy``                | Network proxy settings to use with this context. Defaults to None. *NOTE:* For Chromium on Windows the browser needs to be launched with the global proxy for this option to work. If all contexts override the proxy, global proxy will be never used and can be any string, for example ``proxy={ server: 'http://per-context' }``. |
| ``recordHar``            | Enables [http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/|HAR] recording for all pages into to a file. Must be path to file, example ${OUTPUT_DIR}/har.file. If not specified, the HAR is not recorded. Make sure to await context to close for the to be saved. |
| ``recordVideo``          | Enables video recording for all pages into a folder. If not specified videos are not recorded. Make sure to close context for videos to be saved. Video is not support in remote browsers. |
| ``reduceMotion``         | Emulates `prefers-reduced-motion` media feature, supported values are `reduce`, `no-preference`. |
| ``screen``               | Emulates consistent window screen size available inside web page via window.screen. Is only used when the viewport is set. Example {'width': 414, 'height': 896} |
| ``serviceWorkers``       | Whether to allow sites to register Service workers. Defaults to 'allow'. |
| ``storageState``         | Restores the storage stated created by the `Save Storage State` keyword. Must be full path to the file. |
| ``timezoneId``           | Changes the timezone of the context. See [https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:third_party/icu/source/data/misc/metaZones.txt|ICU`s metaZones.txt] for a list of supported timezone IDs. |
| ``tracing``              | Boolean ``True`` (recommendation) or file path or directory where the [https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-tracing/|tracing] file is saved. The string `{contextid}` will be replaces with the context id. Path to *.zip files can be absolute or relative to ${OUTPUT_DIR}. Path to folders can be absolute or relative to ${OUTPUT_DIR}/browser/traces. If boolean ``True`` or a directory is given, the trace file will automatically be named ``trace_{contextid}.tip``. Temporary trace files will be saved to ${OUTPUT_DIR}/Browser/traces/temp. Tracing is automatically closed when context is closed. Temporary trace files will be automatically deleted at start of each test execution. Trace file can be opened after the test execution by running command from shell: ``rfbrowser show-trace /path/to/trace.zip``. Tracing can also be enables by setting a Robot Framework variable or environment variable ``ROBOT_FRAMEWORK_BROWSER_TRACING`` to ``True``. |
| ``userAgent``            | Specific user agent to use in this context. |
| ``viewport``             | A dictionary containing ``width`` and ``height``. Emulates consistent viewport for each page. Defaults to 1280x720. null disables the default viewport. If ``width`` and ``height`` is  ``0``, the viewport will scale with the window. |


Example:
| Test an iPhone
|     ${device}=    `Get Device`    iPhone X
|     `New Context`    &amp;{device}        # unpacking here with &amp;
|     `New Page`    http://example.com

A BrowserContext is the Playwright object that controls a single browser profile.
Within a context caches and cookies are shared. See
[https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browser#browsernewcontextoptions|Playwright browser.newContext]
for a list of supported options.

If there's no open Browser this keyword will open one. Does not create pages.

<doc>Open a new Page.

A Page is the Playwright equivalent to a tab. See `Browser, Context and Page`
for more information about Page concept.

| =Arguments=    | =Description= |
| ``url``        | Optional URL to navigate the page to. The url should include protocol, e.g. `https://` |
| ``wait_until`` | When to consider operation succeeded, defaults to load. Events can be either: ``domcontentloaded`` - consider operation to be finished when the DOMContentLoaded event is fired. ``load`` - consider operation to be finished when the load event is fired. ``networkidle`` - consider operation to be finished when there are no network connections for at least 500 ms. ``commit`` - consider operation to be finished when network response is received and the document started loading. |


Returns `NewPageDetails` as dictionary for created page.
`NewPageDetails` (dict) contains the keys ``page_id`` and ``video_path``. ``page_id`` is a stable identifier for
the created page. ``video_path`` is path to the created video or empty if video is not
created.

When a `New Page` is called without an open browser, `New Browser`
and `New Context` are executed with default values first.

[https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsertype#browser-type-launch-persistent-context | persistent context].

`New Persistent Context` does basically executes `New Browser`, `New Context` and `New Page` in one step with setting a profile at the same time.

This keyword returns a tuple of browser id, context id and page details. (New in Browser 15.0.0)

| =Argument=               | =Description= |
| ``userDataDir``          | Path to a User Data Directory, which stores browser session data like cookies and local storage. More details for Chromium and Firefox. Note that Chromium's user data directory is the parent directory of the "Profile Path" seen at chrome://version. Pass an empty string to use a temporary directory instead. |
| ``browser``              | Browser type to use. Default is Chromium. |
| ``headless``             | Whether to run browser in headless mode. Defaults to ``True``. |
| other arguments          | Please see `New Browser`, `New Context` and `New Page` for more information about the other arguments. |

If you want to use extensions you need to download the extension as a .zip, enable loading the extension, and load the extensions using chromium arguments like below. Extensions only work with chromium and with a headful browser.

| ${launch_args}=  Set Variable  ["--disable-extensions-except=./ublock/uBlock0.chromium", "--load-extension=./ublock/uBlock0.chromium"]
| ${browserId}  ${contextId}  ${pageDetails}=  `New Persistent Context`  browser=chromium  headless=False  url=https://robocon,io  args=${launch_args}

| Argument | Description |
| time     | The time to pause the clock at. |

Only fires due timers at most once. This is equivalent to user
closing the laptop lid for a while and reopening it at the specified
time and pausing. Pause can not move clock backwards.

Example:
| `Set Time` | 2024-10-31 17:34:00 | # Set the clock to a specific time |
| Do Something | # Implement this in your keyword |
| `Pause At` | 2024-10-31 18:34:00 | # Pause the clock at a specific time |
| Check Something | # Also this is implemented in your keyword |
| `Resume Clock` | # Resume the clock |

<doc>Returns a promise that waits for next download event on page.

To enable downloads context's ``acceptDownloads`` needs to be true.

With default filepath downloaded files are deleted when Context the download happened in is closed.

If browser is connected remotely with `Connect To Browser` then ``saveAs`` must be set to store it locally where the browser runs!

| =Arguments= | =Description= |
| ``saveAs`` | Defines path where the file is saved persistently. File will also temporarily be saved in playwright context's default download location. If empty, generated unique path (GUID) is used and file is deleted when the context is closed. |
| ``wait_for_finished`` | If true, promise will wait for download to finish. If false, promise will resolve immediately after download has started. |
| ``download_timeout`` | Maximum time to wait for download to finish, if ``wait_for_finished`` is set to ``True``. If download is not finished during this time, keyword will be fail. |

Keyword returns dictionary of type `DownloadInfo` which contains downloaded file path
and suggested filename as well as state and downloadID.
Example:
| {
|   "saveAs": "/tmp/robotframework-browser/downloads/2f1b3b7c-1b1b-4b1b-9b1b-1b1b1b1b1b1b",
|   "suggestedFilename": "downloaded_file.txt"
| }

The keyword `New Browser` has a ``downloadsPath`` setting which can be used to set the default download directory.
If `saveAs` is set to a relative path, the file will be saved relative to the browser's ``downloadsPath`` setting or if that is not set, relative to the
Playwright's working directory. If ``saveAs`` is set to an absolute path, the file will be saved to that absolute path independent of ``downloadsPath``.

If the URL for the file to download shall be used, `Download` keyword may be a simpler alternative way to download the file.

Waited promise returns a dictionary which contains saveAs and suggestedFilename as keys. The saveAs contains
where the file is downloaded and suggestedFilename contains the name suggested name for the download.
The suggestedFilename is typically computed by the browser from the Content-Disposition response header
or the download attribute. See the spec on [https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#downloading-resources|whatwg].
Different browsers can use different logic for computing it.

Example usage:
| `New Context`            acceptDownloads=True
| `New Page`               ${LOGIN_URL}
| ${dl_promise}          `Promise To Wait For Download`    /path/to/download/file.name
| `Click`                  id=file_download
| ${file_obj}=           `Wait For`    ${dl_promise}
| File Should Exist      ${file_obj}[saveAs]
| Should Be True         ${file_obj.suggestedFilename}

<doc>Sets the keyword to execute, when a Browser keyword fails.

| =Arguments= | =Description= |
| ``keyword`` | The name of a keyword that will be executed if a Browser keyword fails. It is possible to use any available keyword, including user keywords or keywords from other libraries. |
| ``*args`` | The arguments to the keyword if any. |
| ``scope`` | Scope defines the live time of this setting. Available values are ``Global``, ``Suite`` or ``Test`` / ``Task``. See `Scope Settings` for more details. |

The initial keyword to use is set when `importing` the library, and
the keyword that is used by default is `Take Screenshot`.
Taking a screenshot when something failed is a very useful
feature, but notice that it can slow down the execution.

It is possible to use string ``NONE`` or any other robot falsy name,
case-insensitively, as well as Python ``None`` to disable this
feature altogether.

This keyword returns an object which contains the the previously
registered failure keyword. The return value can be always used to
restore the original value later. The returned object contains
keyword name and the possible arguments used to for the keyword.

If `Take Screenshot` keyword, without arguments, is register as run on failure
keyword, then filename argument default value is not used as screenshot file
name. Instead, ${TEST NAME}_FAILURE_SCREENSHOT_{index} is used as file name.
If there is need to use the filename argument default value, use
robotframework-browser-screenshot-{index} as filename argument value.

Example:
| `Register Keyword To Run On Failure`    Take Screenshot    # Uses ${TEST NAME}_FAILURE_SCREENSHOT_{index} as filename
| `Register Keyword To Run On Failure`    Take Screenshot    robotframework-browser-screenshot-{index}    # Uses robotframework-browser-screenshot-{index} as filename
| ${previous kw}=    `Register Keyword To Run On Failure`    NONE    # Disables run on failure functionality.
| `Register Keyword To Run On Failure`    ${previous kw}
| `Register Keyword To Run On Failure`    Take Screenshot    fullPage=True
| `Register Keyword To Run On Failure`    Take Screenshot    failure-{index}    fullPage=True

<doc>Saves the current active context storage state to a file.

Web apps use cookie-based or token-based authentication, where
authenticated state is stored as
[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies|cookies]
or in
[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage|local storage].
Keyword retrieves the storage state from authenticated contexts and
save it to disk. Then `New Context` can be created with prepopulated
state.

Please note state file may contains secrets and should not be shared
with people outside of your organisation.

The file is created in ${OUTPUTDIR}/browser/state folder and file(s)
are automatically deleted when new test execution starts. File path
is returned by the keyword.

Example:
| Test Case
|     `New context`
|     `New Page`    https://login.page.html
|     #  Perform login
|     `Fill Secret`    id=username    $username
|     `Fill Secret`    id=password    $password
|     `Click`    id=button
|     `Get Text`    id=header    ==    Something
|     #  Save storage to disk
|     ${state_file} =    `Save Storage State`
|     #  Create new context with saved state
|     `New context`    storageState=${state_file}
|     `New Page`    https://login.page.html
|     #  Login is not needed because authentication is read from state file
|     `Get Text`    id=header    ==    Something

<doc>Scrolls an element or the page relative from current position by the given values.

| =Arguments= | =Description= |
| ``selector`` | Selector of the element. If the selector is ``${None}`` or ``${Empty}`` the page itself is scrolled. To ensure an element is in view use `Hover` instead. See the `Finding elements` section for details about the selectors. |
| ``vertical`` | defines how far and in which direction to scroll vertically. It can be a positive or negative number. Positive scrolls down, like ``50``, negative scrolls up, like ``-50``. It can be a percentage value of the absolute scrollable size, like ``9.95%`` or negative like ``-10%``. It can be the string ``height`` to defining to scroll exactly one visible height down or up with ``-height``. _Be aware that some pages do lazy loading and load more content once you scroll down._ The percentage of the current scrollable height is used and may change. |
| ``horizontal`` | defines where to scroll horizontally. Works same as vertical but defines positive values for right and negative values for left. ``width`` defines to scroll exactly one visible range to the right. |
| ``behavior`` | defines whether the scroll happens directly or it scrolls smoothly. |

Keyword uses strict mode, see `Finding elements` for more details about strict mode.

It is possible to define own formatters as lambda functions.

Example:
| `Set Assertion Formatters`    {"Get Text": ["strip", "normalize spaces"]}  # This will convert all kind of spaces to single space and removes spaces from start and end of the string.
| `Set Assertion Formatters`    {"Get Title": ["apply to expected","lambda x: x.replace(' ', '')"]}  # This will remove all spaces from the string.
    | ${value} =    `Get Text`    //div    ==    ${SPACE}Expected${SPACE * 2}Text

<doc>Sets the timeout used in retrying assertions when they fail.

| =Arguments= | =Description= |
| ``timeout`` | Assertion retry timeout will determine how long Browser library will retry an assertion to be true. |
| ``scope``   | Scope defines the live time of that setting. Available values are ``Global``, ``Suite`` or ``Test`` / ``Task``. See `Scope` for more details. |

The other keyword `Set Browser timeout` controls how long Playwright
will perform waiting in the node side for Elements to fulfill the
requirements of the specific keyword.

Returns the previous value of the assertion retry timeout.

Example:
| `Set Browser Timeout`    10 seconds
| ${old} =    `Set Retry Assertions For`    30s
| `Get Title`    ==    Login Page
| `Set Retry Assertions For`    ${old}

Example waits 10 seconds on Playwright to get the page title and library
will retry 30 seconds to make sure that title is correct.

<doc>Sets the prefix for all selectors in the given scope.

| =Arguments= | =Description= |
| ``prefix``   | Prefix for all selectors. Prefix and selector will be separated by a single space. Use ``${None}`` or ``${EMPTY}`` to disable the prefix. |
| ``scope``   | Scope defines the live time of that setting. Available values are ``Global``, ``Suite`` or ``Test`` / ``Task``. See `Scope` for more details. |

Returns the previous value of the prefix.

Example:
| ${old} =    `Set Selector Prefix`    iframe#embedded_page &gt;&gt;&gt;
| `Click`    button#login_btn       # Clicks on button inside iframe with the selector ``iframe#embedded_page &gt;&gt;&gt; button#login_btn``
| `Set Selector Prefix`    ${old}

Example will click on button with id ``login_btn`` inside iframe with id ``embedded_page``.
The resulting selector will be ``iframe#embedded_page &gt;&gt;&gt; button#login_btn``.

The effect of this prefix can be disable by prefixing any selector with ``!prefix ``, with a trailing space,
for single keyword calls. i.e. ``!prefix id=btn_outside_a_frame``

`Get Element`, `Get Elements`, `Get Element By` and `Get Element By Role`
do automatically prefix the returned selector with ``!prefix `` so that it is possible to use
them directly without setting the prefix to ``${None}`` before usage.

| Argument | Description |
| time     | The time to set. Supports Robot Framework date and time format |
| clock_type | The clock type to set. Default is `install`. |

The fixed makes Date.now and new Date() return fixed fake
time at all times, keeps all the timers running.

The system sets current system time but does not trigger any timers.

The install fake timers are used to manually control the flow of time in tests.
They allow you to advance time, fire timers, and control the behavior
of time-dependent functions.

How to use clock related keywords, see

In the case of multiple pages in a single browser,
each page can have its own viewport size. However,
`New Context` allows to set viewport size (and more) for all
later opened pages in the context at once.

`Set Viewport Size` will resize the page.
A lot of websites don't expect phones to change size,
so you should set the viewport size before navigating to
the page with `New Context` before opening the page itself.

<doc>Controls if the keyword banner is shown on page or not.

Keyword call banner is a css overlay that shows the currently executed keyword directly on page.
This is useful for debugging and for showing the test execution on video recordings.
By default, the banner is not shown on page except when running in presenter mode.

The banner can be controlled by an import setting of Browser library. (see `Importing` section)

| =Arguments= | =Description= |
| ``show`` | If `True` banner is shown on page. If `False` banner is not shown on page. If `None` banner is shown on page only when running in presenter mode. |
| ``style`` | Additional css styles to be applied to the banner. These styles are css settings and may override the existing ones for the banner. |
| ``scope``   | Scope defines the live time of that setting. Available values are ``Global``, ``Suite`` or ``Test`` / ``Task``. See `Scope` for more details. |

Example:
| Show Keyword Banner     True    top: 5px; bottom: auto; left: 5px; background-color: #00909077; font-size: 9px; color: black;   # Show banner on top left corner with custom styles
| Show Keyword Banner     False   # Hide banner

<doc>Starts the coverage for the current page.

| =Arguments= | =Description= |
| ``config_file`` | Optional path to [https://www.npmjs.com/package/monocart-coverage-reports#options|options file] |
| ``coverage_type`` | Type of coverage to start. Default is `all`. |
| ``path`` | Absolute or relative directory path (relative to ``${OUTPUT_DIR}/browser/coverage/``) where the coverage is store in a directory with the page id name. |
| ``raw`` | Whether to save raw coverage data. Default is `False`. |
| ``reportAnonymousScripts`` | Whether to report anonymous scripts. Default is `False`. Only valid for JS coverage. |
| ``resetOnNavigation`` | Whether to reset coverage on navigation. Default is `True`. |

The `coverage_type` can be one of the following:
- ``all``: Both [https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-coverage/#coverage-start-css-coverage|CSS] and [https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-coverage/#coverage-start-js-coverage|JS].
- ``css``: [https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-coverage/#coverage-start-css-coverage|CSS].
- ``js``: [https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-coverage/#coverage-start-js-coverage|JS].

Coverage must started when page is open and before any action is
performed on the page. Coverage will be stored when calling `Stop Coverage` keyword
or page or context is closed. This is done automatically when using the auto closing.

The `raw` argument saves the raw coverage data in the coverage folder. The raw data
is needed to combine multiple coverage reports to single report. Singel report can
be created with `rfbrowser coverage /path/to/basefolder/ /path/to/outputfolder/`
command. Pleaee note that the `raw` argument is ignored if the `config_file`
is defined. In this case user is responsible to also set the raw reporter
in the config file. To see more details about combining coverage data, run:
`rfbrowser coverage --help` command.

Example:
| `New Page`
| `Start Coverage`
| `Go To`    ${LOGIN_URL}
| Do Something In The Page
| `Stop Coverage`</doc>

If filename equals to UUID, then filename is created by Python uuid; https://docs.python.org/3/library/uuid.html. If filename equals to EMBED (case insensitive) or ${NONE},  then screenshot is embedded as Base64 image to the log.html. The image is saved temporally to the disk and warning is displayed if removing the temporary file fails. The ${OUTPUTDIR}/browser/ is removed at the first suite startup. |
| ``selector`` | Take a screenshot of the element matched by selector. See the `Finding elements` section for details about the selectors. If not provided take a screenshot of current viewport. |
| ``crop`` | Crops the taken screenshot to the given box. It takes same dictionary as returned from `Get BoundingBox`. Cropping only works on page screenshot, so if no selector is given. |
| ``disableAnimations`` | When set to ``True``, stops CSS animations, CSS transitions and Web Animations. Animations get different treatment depending on their duration:  - finite animations are fast-forwarded to completion, so they'll fire transitionend event.  - infinite animations are canceled to initial state, and then played over after the screenshot. |
| ``fileType`` | ``png`` or ``jpeg`` Specify screenshot type, defaults to ``png`` . |
| ``fullPage`` | When True, takes a screenshot of the full scrollable page, instead of the currently visible viewport. Defaults to False. |
| ``highlight_selector`` | Highlights elements while taking the screenshot. Highlight method is ``playwright``. This highlighting also automatically happens if the Robot Framework variable ``${ROBOT_FRAMEWORK_BROWSER_FAILING_SELECTOR}`` is set to a selector string and is available on page. This is the case if ``highlight_on_failure`` has been set to ``True`` when importing Browser library. |
| ``log_screenshot`` | When set to ``False`` the screenshot is taken but not logged into log.html. |
| ``mask`` | Specify selectors that should be masked when the screenshot is taken. Masked elements will be overlayed with a pink box ``#FF00FF`` that completely covers its bounding box. Argument can take a single selector string or a list of selector strings if multiple different elements should be masked. |
| ``maskColor`` | Specify the color of the overlay box for masked elements, in CSS color format. Default color is pink #FF00FF. |
| ``omitBackground`` | Hides default white background and allows capturing screenshots with transparency. Not applicable to jpeg images. |
| ``quality`` | The quality of the image, between 0-100. Not applicable to png images. |
| ``scale`` | ``css`` or ``device``. ``css`` will reduce the image size and ``device`` keeps image in original size. Defaults to ``device``. |
| ``return_as`` | Defines what this keyword returns. Possible values are documented in `ScreenshotReturnType`. It can be either a path to the screenshot file as string or Path object, or the image data as bytes or base64 encoded string. |
| ``timeout`` | Maximum time how long taking screenshot can last, defaults to library timeout. Supports Robot Framework time format, like 10s or 1 min, pass 0 to disable timeout. The default value can be changed by using the `Set Browser Timeout` keyword. |

Keyword uses strict mode if selector is defined. See `Finding elements` for more details
about strict mode.

Example
| `Take Screenshot`                                 # Takes screenshot from page with default filename
| `Take Screenshot`   selector=id=username_field    # Captures element in image
| # Takes screenshot with jpeg extension, defines image quality and timeout how long taking screenshot should last
| `Take Screenshot`   fullPage=True    fileType=jpeg    quality=50    timeout=10s
| `Take Screenshot`   EMBED                         # Screenshot is embedded as Base64 image to the log.html.
| `Take Screenshot`   UUID                          # Takes screenshot from page with filename generated by: https://docs.python.org/3/library/uuid.html.

<doc>Simulates tap on the element found by ``selector``.

Requires that the ``hasTouch`` option of the `New Context` be set to true.
This method taps the element by performing the following steps:
- Wait for actionability checks on the element, unless force option is set.
- Scroll the element into view if needed.
- Use page.touchscreen to tap the center of the element, or the specified position.
- Wait for initiated navigations to either succeed or fail, unless noWaitAfter option is set.

| =Arguments= | =Description= |
| ``selector`` | Selector element to click. See the `Finding elements` section for details about the selectors. |
| ``*modifiers`` | Modifier keys to press. Ensures that only these modifiers are pressed during the click, and then restores current modifiers back. If not specified, currently pressed modifiers are used. Modifiers can be specified in any order, and multiple modifiers can be specified. Valid modifier keys are ``Control``, ``Alt``, ``Shift`` and ``Meta``. |
| ``force`` | Whether to bypass the actionability checks. Defaults to false. |
| ``noWaitAfter`` | Deprecated. This option has no effect. Actions that initiate navigations are waiting for these navigations to happen and for pages to start loading. You can opt out of waiting via setting this flag. You would only need this option in the exceptional cases such as navigating to inaccessible pages. Defaults to ``False``. |
| ``position_x`` ``position_y`` | A point to click relative to the top-left corner of element bounding-box. Only positive values within the bounding-box are allowed. If not specified, clicks to some visible point of the element. |
| ``trial`` | When set, this method only performs the actionability checks and skips the action. Defaults to ``False``.  |

Example:
| New Context    hasTouch=${False}
| New Page    ${URL}
| Tap    css=input#login_button

<doc>Types the given secret from ``variable_name`` into the text field
found by ``selector``.

This keyword does not log secret in Robot Framework logs, if keyword resolves
the variable value internally. If ``enable_playwright_debug`` is enabled in
the library import, secret will be always visible as plain text in the playwright
debug logs, regardless of the Robot Framework log level.

| =Arguments= | =Description= |
| ``selector`` | Selector of the text field. See the `Finding elements` section for details about the selectors. |
| ``secret`` | Environment variable name with % prefix or a local variable with $ prefix that has the secret text value. Variable names can be used with and without curly braces. |
| ``delay`` | Delay between the single key strokes. It may be either a number or a Robot Framework time string. Time strings are fully explained in an appendix of Robot Framework User Guide. Defaults to ``0 ms``. Example: ``50 ms`` |
| ``clear`` | Set to false, if the field shall not be cleared before typing. Defaults to true. |

This keyword does not log secret in Robot Framework logs, when
keyword resolves the ``secret`` variable internally.
When ``secret`` variable is prefixed with `$`, without the curly braces,
library will resolve the corresponding Robot Framework variable.

If ``secret`` variable is prefixed with `%`, library will resolve
corresponding environment variable. Example `$Password`` will
resolve to ``${Password}`` Robot Framework variable.
Also ``%ENV_PWD`` will resolve to ``%{ENV_PWD}`` environment variable.

*Using normal Robot Framework variables like ``${password}`` will not work!*

*Normal plain text will not work.*
If you want to use plain text, use `Type Text` keyword instead.

This keyword will also work with a give cryptographic cipher text, that has been
encrypted by Crypto library.
See [https://github.com/Snooz82/robotframework-crypto | Crypto Library] for more details.

Keyword uses strict mode, see `Finding elements` for more details about strict mode.

See `Type Text` for details.

Example
| `Type Secret`    input#username_field    $username      # Keyword resolves ${username} variable value from Robot Framework variables
| `Type Secret`    input#username_field    %username      # Keyword resolves $USERNAME/%USERNAME% variable value from environment variables
| `Type Secret`    input#username_field    ${username}    # Robot Framework resolves the variable value, but secrect can leak to Robot framework output files.

<doc>Uploads file from ``path`` to file input element matched by selector.

Fails if upload is not done before library timeout.
Therefor it may be necessary to increase the timeout with `Set Browser Timeout`.
It is possible to upload multiple files or folder by defining additional paths
or folders. in `extra_paths`.

If path is a directory, it will be uploaded all files from the directory.
Subdirectories are not included. It is possible to upload files and directories
with the same keyword.

| =Arguments= | =Description= |
| ``selector`` | Identifies the file input element. |
| ``path`` | Path to the file or folder to be uploaded. Path can  FileUploadBuffer dictionary |
| ``extra_paths`` | Additional paths to files or folders to be uploaded. |

if ``path`` is  `FileUploadBuffer` dictionary, then structure should be:
| {
|   'name': `str`,
|   'mimeType': `str`,
|   'buffer': `str`
| }

If ``path`` argument is `FileUploadBuffer`, then ``extra_paths`` argument is not supported and
using it will raise an error.

Upload single file example:
| `Upload File By Selector`    //input[@type='file']    big_file.zip

Upload many files example:
| `Upload File By Selector`    //input[@type='file']    file1.zip    file2.zip    file3.zip

Upload folder example:
| `Upload File By Selector`    //input[@type='file']    /path/to/folder

Upload as buffer example:
| ${text} =    Get File    /path/to/file    # Read file from disk
| VAR    &amp;{buffer}    name=not_here.txt    mimeType=text/plain    buffer=${text}    # Create buffer dictionary
| `Upload File By Selector`    id=file_chooser    ${buffer}    # Upload buffer

<doc>Returns a promise to wait for next dialog on page, handles it with ``action`` and optionally verifies the dialogs text.

Dialog/alert can be any of alert, beforeunload, confirm or prompt.

| =Arguments= | =Description= |
| ``action`` | How to handle the alert. Can be ``accept`` or ``dismiss``. |
| ``prompt_input`` | The value to enter into prompt. Only valid if ``action`` argument equals ``accept``. Defaults to empty string. |
| ``text`` | Optional text to verify the dialogs text. |
| ``timeout`` | Optional timeout in Robot Framework time format. |


The main difference between this keyword and `Handle Future Dialogs`
is that `Handle Future Dialogs` keyword is automatically set as promise.
But this keyword must be called as argument to `Promise To` keyword. Also this
keyword can optionally verify the dialogue text and return it. If ``text`` is
argument ``None`` or is not set, dialogue text is not verified.

Example with returning text:

| ${promise} =         `Promise To`    `Wait For Alert`    action=accept
| `Click`               id=alerts
| ${text} =            `Wait For`      ${promise}
| Should Be Equal      ${text}         Am an alert

Example with text verify:

| ${promise} =       `Promise To`    Wait For Alert    action=accept    text=Am an alert
| Click              id=alerts
| ${text} =          `Wait For`      ${promise}

<doc>Returns a promise to wait for multiple dialog on a page.

Handles each alert/dialog with ``actions`` and optionally verifies the dialogs texts.
Dialog/alert can be any of alert, beforeunload, confirm or prompt.

| =Arguments= | =Description= |
| ``actions`` | List of how to handle the alerts. Can be ``accept`` or ``dismiss``. |
| ``prompt_inputs`` | List of the values to enter into prompt. Only valid if ``action`` argument equals ``accept``. Defaults to empty string. IF input not preset, use None |
| ``texts`` | List of optional text to verify the dialogs text. Use None if text verification should be disabled. |
| ``timeout`` | Optional timeout in Robot Framework time format. |

There must be equal amount of items in ``actions``, ``prompt_inputs`` and ``texts``  lists.
Use None if texts and/or prompt_inputs are not needed.

This keyword works in same way as `Wait For Alert` but can handle multiple alerts
with one promise. Lie `Wait For Alert` keyword, this keyword must be called as
argument to `Promise To` keyword.

Example to handle two alerts, first one is accepted and second one is dismissed:

| ${promise} =    Promise To
| ...    Wait For Alerts
| ...    ["accept", "dismiss"]
| ...    [None, None]
| ...    [None, None]
| Click    id=alerts
| ${texts} =    Wait For    ${promise}

Example to handle confirm and prompt alert. Example assumes that the first is a
confirm and second one is prompt:

| ${promise} =    Promise To
| ...    Wait For Alerts
| ...    ["dismiss", "accept"]
| ...    [None, "I am a prompt"]
| ...    ["First alert accepted?", None]
| Click    id=confirmAndPrompt
| ${texts} =    Wait For    ${promise}

<doc>Waits for a condition, defined with Browser getter keywords to become True.

This Keyword is basically just a wrapper around our assertion keywords, but with a timeout.
It can be used to wait for anything that also can be asserted with our keywords.

In comparison to Robot Frameworks `Wait Until Keywords Succeeds` this keyword is more
readable and easier to use but is limited to Browser libraries assertion keywords.

| =Arguments= | =Description= |
| ``condition`` | A condition, defined with Browser getter keywords, without the word ``Get``. |
| ``*args`` | Arguments to pass to the condition keyword. |
| ``timeout`` | Timeout to wait for the condition to become True. Uses default timeout of the library if not set. As the other assertion keywords this timeout only influences the time the assertion is retried. The browser timeout is used to wait for the element to be found. |
| ``message`` | Overrides the default error message. |


The easiest way to use this keyword is first starting with an assertion keyword with assertion like: `Get Text`

Start:
| `Get Text`    id=status_bar   contains    Done

Then you replace the word `Get` with `Wait For Condition    ` and if necessary add the timeout argument.

End:
| `Wait For Condition`    Text    id=status_bar   contains    Done


Example usage:
| `Wait For Condition`    Element States    id=cdk-overlay-0    ==    detached
| `Wait For Condition`    Element States     //h1    contains    visible    editable    enabled    timeout=2 s
| `Wait For Condition`    Title    should start with    Robot
| `Wait For Condition`    Url    should end with    robotframework.org

<doc>Waits for the element found by ``selector`` to satisfy state option.

Note that Browser library has `Implicit waiting` mechanisms. Depending on
the situation you might not need to use `Wait for Elements State`.

If users experience reliability issues with this keyword, consider using
`Wait for Condition` with `Get Element States` keyword instead.
`Wait For Elements State` uses features of Playwright to wait for element states.
However, in some situations these features might not work as expected.
`Wait for Condition` with `Get Element States` is more robust as it uses
Browser library's own waiting mechanisms that actively polls the state of an element.

State options could be either appear/disappear from dom, or become visible/hidden.
If at the moment of calling the keyword, the selector already satisfies the condition,
the keyword will return immediately.

If the selector doesn't satisfy the condition within the timeout the keyword will FAIL.

| =Arguments= | =Description= |
| ``selector`` | Selector of the corresponding object. See the `Finding elements` section for details about the selectors. |
| ``state`` | See `ElementState` for explanation. |
| ``timeout`` | uses default timeout from library if not set. |
| ``message`` | overrides the default error message. The ``message`` argument accepts `{selector}`, `{function}`, and `{timeout}` [https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format|format] options. The `{function}` formatter is same ``state`` argument value. |

Keyword uses strict mode, see `Finding elements` for more details about strict mode.

Example:
| `Wait For Elements State`    //h1    visible    timeout=2 s
| `Wait For Elements State`    //hi    focused    1s

<doc>Polls JavaScript expression or function in browser until it returns a (JavaScript) truthy value.

| =Arguments= | =Description= |
| ``function`` | A valid javascript function or a javascript function body. For example ``() =&gt; true`` and ``true`` will behave similarly. |
| ``selector`` | Selector to resolve and pass to the JavaScript function. This will be the first argument the function receives. If given a selector a function is necessary, with an argument to capture the elementhandle. For example ``(element) =&gt; document.activeElement === element`` See the `Finding elements` section for details about the selectors. |

| ``timeout`` | Uses default timeout of the library if not set. |
| ``message`` | overrides the default error message. The ``message`` argument accepts `{selector}`, `{function}`, and `{timeout}` [https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format|format] options. |

<doc>Waits that the page reaches the required load state.

This resolves when the page reaches a required load state, load by default.
The navigation must have been committed when this method is called. If current document has already
reached the required state, resolves immediately.

| =Arguments= | =Description= |
| ``state``   | State to wait for, defaults to `load`. Possible values are `load|domcontentloaded|networkidle` |
| ``timeout`` | Timeout supports Robot Framework time format. Uses browser timeout if not set.                 |

If the state has been already reached while loading current document, the underlying Playwright will
resolve immediately. Can be one of:

| 'load' - wait for the load event to be fired.
| 'domcontentloaded' - wait for the DOMContentLoaded event to be fired.
| 'networkidle' - DISCOURAGED wait until there are no network connections for at least 500 ms.

Example:
| `Go To`                         ${URL}
| `Wait For Load State`    domcontentloaded    timeout=3s</doc>

| =Arguments= | =Description= |
| ``url`` | Expected navigation target address either the exact match or a JavaScript-like regex wrapped in ``/`` symbols. |
| ``timeout`` | Timeout supports Robot Framework time format. Uses default timeout if not set. |
| ``wait_until`` | When to consider operation succeeded, defaults to load. Events can be either: ``domcontentloaded`` - consider operation to be finished when the DOMContentLoaded event is fired. ``load`` - consider operation to be finished when the load event is fired. ``networkidle`` - consider operation to be finished when there are no network connections for at least 500 ms. ``commit`` - consider operation to be finished when network response is received and the document started loading. |


Keyword works only when page is loaded and does not work if URL fragment changes. Example if
https://marketsquare.github.io/robotframework-browser/Browser.html changes to
https://marketsquare.github.io/robotframework-browser/Browser.html#Wait%20For%20Navigation
keyword will fail.

Example:
| `Go To`                  ${ROOT_URL}/redirector.html
| `Wait for navigation`    ${ROOT_URL}/posted.html    wait_until=${wait_until}

| =Arguments= | =Description= |

By default (with empty string) matches first available request.

See `Wait For Response` for more details.

*CAUTION:* Before Browser library 17.0.0, the ``matcher`` argument was always either a regex or JS function.
But the regex did not needed to be in slashes.
The most simple way to migrate to the new syntax is to add slashes around the matcher.
So ``/api/get/json`` becomes ``//api/get/json/``.

<doc>Waits for response matching matcher and returns the response as robot dict.

The response, which is returned by this keyword, is a robot dictionary with following attributes:
  - ``status`` &lt;int&gt; The status code of the response.
  - ``statusText`` &lt;str&gt; Status text corresponding to ``status``, e.g OK or INTERNAL SERVER ERROR. This may not be available for all browser.
  - ``body`` &lt;dict | str&gt; The response body. If the body can be parsed as a JSON object,
  it will be returned as Python dictionary, otherwise it is returned as a string.
  - ``headers`` &lt;dict&gt; A dictionary containing all response headers.
  - ``ok`` &lt;bool&gt; Whether the request was successful, i.e. the ``status`` is range 200-299.
  - ``request`` &lt;dict&gt; containing ``method`` &lt;str&gt;, ``headers`` &lt;dict&gt; and ``postData`` &lt;dict&gt; | &lt;str&gt;
  - ``url`` &lt;str&gt; url of the request.

| =Arguments= | =Description= |
| ``matcher`` | Request URL matcher. Can be a string (Glob-Pattern), JavaScript RegExp (encapsulated in / with following flags) or JavaScript arrow-function that receives the Response object and returns a boolean. By default (with empty string) matches first available request. For additional information, see the Playwright [https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-wait-for-response|page.waitForResponse] documentation. |
| ``timeout`` | Timeout supports Robot Framework time format. Uses default timeout if not set. |

*CAUTION:* Before Browser library 17.0.0, the ``matcher`` argument was always either a regex or JS function.
But the regex did not needed to be in slashes.
The most simple way to migrate to the new syntax is to add slashes around the matcher.
So ``/api/get/json`` becomes ``//api/get/json/``.

== Matcher Examples: ==

=== Glob-Pattern: ===

Glob-Patterns are strings that can contain wildcards. The following wildcards are supported:

Possible wildcards/patterns are:
- ``*`` matches any number of characters, except ``/``
- ``**`` matches any number of characters, including ``/``
- ``?`` matches one character, except ``/``
- ``[abc]`` matches one character in the brackets (in this example ``a``, ``b`` or ``c``)
- ``[a-z]`` matches one character in the range (in this example ``a`` to ``z``)
- ``{foo,bar,baz}`` matches one of the strings in the braces (in this example ``foo``, ``bar`` or ``baz``)

Example:
| `Wait For Response`    **/api/get/text    # matches any request with url ending with /api/get/text. example: https://browser.fi/api/get/text

=== RegExp: ===

Regular Expressions are JavaScript regular expressions encapsulated in ``/`` with optional following flags:
Be aware that backslashes need to be escaped in Robot Framework, e.g. ``\\w`` instead of ``\w``.
See [https://regex101.com|regex101] for more information on Regular Expressions.

Example:
| `Wait For Response`    /http://\\w+:\\d+/api/get/text/i    # matches any request with url ending with /api/get/text and containing http:// followed by any word and port. example: http://localhost:8080/api/get/text

=== JavaScript Arrow-Function: ===

JavaScript Arrow-Functions are anonymous JavaScript functions that receive the
[https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-response|Response] object and return a boolean.

Example:
| `Wait For Response`    response =&gt; response.url() === 'http://localhost/api/post' &amp;&amp; response.status() === 200    # matches any response with url http://localhost/api/post and status code 200

== Robot Examples: ==

Synchronous Example:
| `Click`                \#delayed_request    # Creates response which should be waited before next actions
| `Wait For Response`    matcher=/http://\\w+:\\d+/api/get/text/i
| `Click`                \#save

Asynchronous Example:
| ${promise} =    `Promise To`    `Wait For Response`    timeout=60s
| `Click`           \#delayed_request    # Creates response which should be waited before pressing save.
| `Click`           \#next
| `Wait For`        ${promise}            # Waits for the response
| `Click`           \#save

JavaScript Function Example:
| `Click`               \#delayed_request    # Creates response which should be waited before pressing save.
| `Wait For Response`   [https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-response/|response] =&gt; response.url().endsWith('json') &amp;&amp; response.request().method() === 'GET'

|       ``strip``       | Removes spaces from the beginning and end of the value     |
| ``case insensitive``  | Converts value to lower case before comparing              |
| ``apply to expected`` | Applies rules also for the expected value                  |

Formatters are applied to the value before assertion is performed and keywords returns a value where rule is
applied. Formatter is only applied to the value which keyword returns and not all rules are valid for all assertion
operators. If ``apply to expected`` formatter is defined, then formatters are then formatter are also applied to
expected value.</doc>

<type name="AutoClosingLevel" type="Enum">
<doc>Controls when contexts and pages are closed during the test execution.

If automatic closing level is `TEST`, contexts and pages that are created during a single test are
automatically closed when the test ends. Contexts and pages that are created during suite setup are
closed when the suite teardown ends.

If automatic closing level is `SUITE`, all contexts and pages that are created during the test suite
are closed when the suite teardown ends.

If automatic closing level is `MANUAL`, nothing is closed automatically while the test execution
is ongoing. All browsers, context and pages are automatically closed when test execution ends.

If automatic closing level is `KEEP`, nothing is closed automatically while the test execution
is ongoing. Also, nothing is closed when test execution ends, including the node process. Therefore,
it is users responsibility to close all browsers, context and pages and ensure that all process
that are left running after the test execution end are closed. This level is only intended for
test case development and must not be used when running tests in CI or similar environments.

Automatic closing can be configured or switched off with the auto_closing_level library import
parameter.

Examples: ``good``, ``hyvä`` (same as ``hyv\xE4``), ``\x00`` (the null byte)

Integers and sequences of integers are converted to matching bytes directly.
They must be in range 0-255.

Examples: ``0`` (converted to the null byte), ``[82, 70]`` (converted to ``RF``)

Support for integers and sequences of integers is new in Robot Framework 7.4.

This is the default behavior if the SameSite attribute is not specified. |
| ``None`` | means that the browser sends the cookie with both cross-site and same-site requests. The Secure attribute must also be set when setting this value. |

<doc>Role selector does not replace accessibility audits and conformance tests,
but rather gives early feedback about the ARIA guidelines.

Many html elements have an implicitly
[https://w3c.github.io/html-aam/#html-element-role-mappings|defined role]
that is recognized by the role selector.
You can find all the [https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#role_definitions|supported roles] here.
ARIA guidelines do not recommend duplicating implicit roles and attributes
by setting role and/or aria-* attributes to default values.</doc>

<doc>Some keywords which manipulates library settings have a scope argument.
With that scope argument one can set the "live time" of that setting.
Available Scopes are: ``Global``, ``Suite`` and ``Test`` / ``Task``.
Is a scope finished, this scoped setting, like timeout, will no longer be used and the previous higher scope setting applies again.

Live Times:

- A ``Global`` scope will live forever until it is overwritten by another Global scope.
  Or locally temporarily overridden by a more narrow scope.
- A ``Suite`` scope will locally override the Global scope and
  live until the end of the Suite within it is set, or if it is overwritten
  by a later setting with Global or same scope.
  Children suite does inherit the setting from the parent suite but also may have
  its own local Suite setting that then will be inherited to its children suites.
- A ``Test`` or ``Task`` scope will be inherited from its parent suite but when set,
  lives until the end of that particular test or task.

A new set higher order scope will always remove the lower order scope which may be in charge.
So the setting of a Suite scope from a test, will set that scope to the robot file suite where
that test is and removes the Test scope that may have been in place.</doc>

<type name="SelectionStrategy" type="Enum">
<doc>SelectionStrategy to be used. Refers to Playwrights ``page.getBy***`` functions. See [https://playwright.dev/docs/locators|Playwright Locators]

== AltText ==
All images should have an alt attribute that describes the image. You can locate an image based on the text alternative using page.getByAltText().

For example, consider the following DOM structure.
| &lt;img alt="playwright logo" src="/img/playwright-logo.svg" width="100" /&gt;

== Label ==
Allows locating input elements by the text of the associated ``&lt;label&gt;`` or ``aria-labelledby`` element, or by the ``aria-label`` attribute.

For example, this method will find inputs by label "Username" and "Password" in the following DOM:

| &lt;input aria-label="Username"&gt;
| &lt;label for="password-input"&gt;Password:&lt;/label&gt;
| &lt;input id="password-input"&gt;

== Placeholder ==
Allows locating input elements by the placeholder text.

Example:
| &lt;input type="email" placeholder="name@example.com" /&gt;

== TestId ==
Locate element by the test id.

Currently only the exact attribute ``data-testid`` is supported.

Example:
| &lt;button data-testid="directions"&gt;Itinéraire&lt;/button&gt;

== Text ==
Allows locating elements that contain given text.

Matching by text always normalizes whitespace, even with exact match.
For example, it turns multiple spaces into one, turns line breaks into spaces and ignores leading and trailing whitespace.
Input elements of the type button and submit are matched by their value instead of the text content.
For example, locating by text "Log in" matches &lt;input type=button value="Log in"&gt;.

== Title ==
Allows locating elements by their title attribute.

Example:
| &lt;img alt="playwright logo" src="/img/playwright-logo.svg" title="Playwright" width="100" /&gt;</doc>

binaries for all browsers, no additional drivers e.g. geckodriver are needed.

All these browsers that cover more than 85% of the world wide used browsers,
can be tested on Windows, Linux and MacOS.
Theres is not need for dedicated machines anymore.</doc>

<doc>Strings are expected to represent a time interval in one of
the time formats Robot Framework supports:
- a number representing seconds like ``42`` or ``10.5``
- a time string like ``1 hour 2 seconds`` or ``1h 2s``
- a "timer" string like ``01:02`` (1 minute 2 seconds) or ``01:00:03`` (1 hour 3 seconds)

Integers and floats are considered to be seconds.

See the [https://robotframework.org/robotframework/|Robot Framework User Guide]
for more details about the supported time formats.

<doc>Defines in what detail level keywords are written to Playwright trace.

Playwrright trace is a full log of all playwright actions and events that happen in the browser during the test run.
This includes all API calls, events, logs, network requests, and responses as well as the DOM at every moment during execution.
This trace can be activated with the ``tracing`` parameter of `New Context` keyword.

- ``Full`` All keyword calls are written to trace as groups even if they do not call Browser keywords.
- ``Browser`` Just Browser library keywords are written to the logs as groups.
- ``Playwright`` No additional keywords are logged, just the Playwright API calls.</doc>
