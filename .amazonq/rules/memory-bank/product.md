# Product Overview

## Project Purpose
Books Database Service is a specialized QA test generation baseline designed for evaluating AI tools' capabilities in generating Robot Framework test suites. This repository provides a stable application environment where different AI agents can generate and compare test automation approaches while keeping the underlying application code unchanged.

## Key Features
- **Stable Test Target**: FastAPI-based books database service with web UI and REST API
- **MCP Integration**: Model Context Protocol servers for Robot Framework execution and documentation
- **Containerized Environment**: Docker Compose setup with all dependencies pre-configured
- **Test Infrastructure**: Dedicated directories for Robot Framework tests and results
- **AI Tool Evaluation**: Structured branching system for comparing different AI assistants' test generation capabilities

## Target Users
- **QA Engineers**: Evaluating AI-assisted test automation approaches
- **AI Tool Researchers**: Comparing different AI models' test generation capabilities
- **Test Automation Teams**: Benchmarking Robot Framework test creation methods
- **DevOps Engineers**: Understanding MCP-powered testing workflows

## Use Cases
- Generate comprehensive Robot Framework test suites using AI assistants
- Compare test quality and coverage across different AI tools and models
- Evaluate MCP server integration for test automation workflows
- Benchmark AI-generated tests against a stable application baseline
- Research AI capabilities in understanding application behavior and creating appropriate tests

## Value Proposition
Provides a controlled, reproducible environment for evaluating AI tools' test generation capabilities while eliminating variables from changing application code, allowing focus purely on test quality and AI assistant performance.
